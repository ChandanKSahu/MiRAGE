Annual Report 2024

The figure presents a schematic diagram illustrating a sequential process or workflow. A white line with circular nodes represents the progression through distinct stages. The line originates from a defined starting point and traverses a complex path, branching into multiple parallel paths at the end. The nodes along the line likely represent key milestones or decision points within the process. The branching at the end indicates potential divergence into multiple outcomes or parallel execution paths. This diagram suggests a process that starts with a single input, progresses through a series of defined steps, and ultimately leads to multiple possible results or parallel operations. This implies the need for careful management of resources and potential for parallelization in the design.

## Year-End Share Price

Here's a technical summary of the provided figure:

1.  Context: The figure is a bar graph illustrating a time-series of numerical values. The primary objective is to show the trend of a quantity over a five-year period.
2.  Deconstruction: The x-axis represents the year, ranging from '20 to '24. The y-axis represents a quantity in US dollars ($), ranging from approximately $328 to $498. The bars represent the value of the quantity for each year. The values are: $328.73 ('20), $471.93 ('21), $334.94 ('22), $440.52 ('23), and $498.03 ('24).
3.  Implication: The graph indicates a fluctuating trend with an overall increase in the quantity over the five-year period. The quantity experienced a significant increase from '20 to '21, a decrease from '21 to '22, an increase from '22 to '23, and a further increase from '23 to '24. This suggests that the quantity is subject to variability, but the overall trend is positive.

## Chairman's Letter

## Dear Fellow Shareholder:

Looking back at 2024, I'm filled with pride and admiration for the people of S&amp;P Global. Our people, in every corner of the company, are exceptional.

There's no greater testament to a person's character and leadership than turning over the reins when the organization they're heading is performing at a very high level. Stepping aside and making way for a new leader to take your place is exceedingly difficult and rare.

## Paying Tribute to a World-Class CEO

Our former President and CEO Doug Peterson managed to do exactly that. He is a visionary leader, seeing trends before many others did. He built a remarkable record of growth at our company, all the while cultivating the talent around him who could take over when the time was right to retire.

Completing the successful integration of IHS Markit was the perfect moment, which created the opportunity last year resulting in the Board of Directors unanimously electing Martina Cheung as our new chief executive.

I congratulate Doug on a fabulous 11-year run as CEO. He was bold while remaining humble. He was a great communicator who was also a great listener. He set very high standards for operational excellence and for integrity. And he got results.

Allow me to outline just a few of his accomplishments:

- -He refocused our company's business portfolio to concentrate on financial data and analytics, while divesting a number of our businesses, including J.D. Power and McGraw-Hill Construction.
- -He made three game-changing acquisitions: SNL Financial, Kensho, and IHS Markit.
- -He refreshed the Board of Directors, reorganized the management team, and created a new operating model.
- -He rebranded the company as S&amp;P Global, and we are now one of the most distinguished and respected brands in the financial services industry.
- -He nudged the company's culture to become more innovative, client-centric, and growth oriented.

During his tenure as CEO, S&amp;P Global returned more than $30 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, and our market capitalization increased to approximately $150 billion from $16 billion.

He checked all the boxes of a world-class leader, and he leaves a tremendous legacy of success. The Board and I extended our deepest thanks to Doug for the incredible job he did.

## A New Leader for a New Era

Martina is the right leader to take the baton from Doug and lead S&amp;P Global. She has all the qualities you want in a chief executive.

## Martina is the right leader to take the baton from Doug and lead S&amp;P Global. She has all the qualities you want in a chief executive.

She knows our company well and has proven to be effective at leading and growing key businesses. She has a clear plan to drive growth. And she cares deeply about our people, shareholders, and customers. The Board has complete confidence in her ability to move our company forward.

## Refreshing the Board of Directors

The Board welcomed Martina last summer. This year will bring more changes to the Board.

This is my last shareholders' letter as Non-Executive Chairman. I advised the company that pursuant to the Board's refreshment policies under its Corporate Governance Guidelines, I will retire from the Board when my current term as a director expires in May at our Annual Meeting. At that time, I am very pleased Ian Livingston will step in to serve as our next Chairman. Ian is an excellent choice. He has been a valued member of the Board since 2020 and has deep global business experience, including in finance, accounting, and technology, and he previously served as a CEO, CFO, and minister in the British government.

Joining Doug and me in retiring from the Board in May are Bob Kelly and Gay Huey Evans. Bob and Gay have been wonderful colleagues and directors. They always provided fresh insights and offered management sound advice. The Board, Doug, and I will miss serving with them.

I am grateful to have had the opportunity to serve as Chairman over the last four and a half years and as a director since 2011.

S&amp;P Global is a remarkable company with unique products and services and extraordinarily talented people. I am confident our company is in the right hands.

Thank you for your support and interest in S&amp;P Global.

Sincerely,

This figure is not a technical diagram, plot, or schematic. It appears to be a signature or stylized text. Therefore, it does not contain any technical data, functional relationships, or engineering insights that can be summarized.

The provided image is a grayscale photograph, likely intended for use in a system requiring facial recognition or biometric analysis. The primary objective is to capture facial features and texture for identification or authentication purposes. Key features include the distribution of light and shadow across the face, which provides information about the surface geometry and texture. The grayscale format reduces color information, focusing instead on luminance variations. The image captures the subject's face, including eyes, nose, mouth, and surrounding skin texture. The presence of a suit and tie indicates a controlled environment, potentially influencing the lighting conditions and facial expression. The engineering implication is that the image can be used to train or test facial recognition algorithms, evaluate the performance of biometric authentication systems under controlled lighting conditions, and assess the impact of grayscale conversion on recognition accuracy.

## CEO's Letter

## Dear Fellow Shareholder:

It's an honor to write to you for the first time here as S&amp;P Global's CEO. Since being elected in November, I have been listening and learning from you, our shareholders, as well as from employees, clients, and partners.

These conversations reinforce my conviction that ours is a phenomenal business and that we have the products, capabilities, and expertise to make it even better.

Our mission today, in this era of rapid innovation and change, is as clear and relevant as it was to our founders in the 1800s: to provide the insights customers need to make critical business decisions.

We have extraordinarily deep and rich data sets. We have incredibly talented and dedicated people who produce specialized analyses, research, and benchmarks. We build leading capabilities to leverage generative AI in valueenhancing ways. And we have a great culture that prioritizes innovation and embraces the highest ethical standards.

However, our markets are evolving and the ways we have done business must change as well.

As part of the CEO-transition process, I have met with over 100 CEOs to deepen our relationships with strategic customers. These conversations have revealed a consistent theme: the business environment is more dynamic than many can remember.

On the one hand, there are risks and uncertainties-from the resilience of supply chains to more severe natural disasters and higher-for-longer interest rates. On the other hand, there is a significant amount of optimism about growth. There are expectations for improved private equity deal-flow. There are opportunities across capital markets, private credit, infrastructure, and the tokenization of financial assets. And everyone is investing in GenAI.

As I spoke with CEOs about the changing landscape and how our teams can help them, I often heard 'I didn't know you do that, too.'

This revealing perspective-combined with powerful secular trends such as AI, energy transition, and public and private market dynamics-offers S&amp;P Global opportunities to blend our historical strengths with new ways of working and bring the full strength of our company to our customers.

That's why we created the Chief Client Office. This team is making sure that our customers understand the full breadth and depth of everything that we do. Importantly, this group will bring consistency to our go-tomarket practices and will bolster our strategic client relationships.

Our enterprise-wide client focus is just one example of where we are moving quickly and in new ways to unlock the potential of everyone with whom we do business.

The themes I'm hearing from customers align with our competitive advantages and reinvigorate our optimism and confidence in our ability to compete and win now and in the future.

## The long-term prospects of S&amp;P Global are bright because we have aligned our businesses around growing global markets and five areas of strategic importance.

## Year in Review

S&amp;P Global has a strong record of producing excellent financial performance. Last year was no exception. In 2024:

- -Revenue, excluding Engineering Solutions, increased 15%.
- -Adjusted diluted earnings per share rose 25%.
- -And adjusted operating margin expanded 310 basis points.

Given this progress and the confidence we have in the future, earlier this year the Board of Directors approved a 5.5% increase in the company's regular dividend, continuing a 52-year history of dividend increases. We returned $4.4 billion to shareholders over the course of 2024, through our dividend and the repurchase of 6.7 million shares.

Last year's accomplishments would not have been possible without the leadership and vision of my predecessor, Doug Peterson. In October, Doug retired as President and CEO of S&amp;P Global.

Doug remains a senior advisor to the company until the end of this year and will retire from our Board in May. I have benefited from his support, counsel, and judgment. I thank Doug for all he's done during his outstanding 11 years as CEO. He produced exceptional results and led with extraordinary empathy and wisdom, creating a legacy that I am deeply honored to follow.

## 2024's Strategic Initiatives

Last year we continued to invest in innovation and in strategic initiatives.

A notable success was expanding our GenAI initiatives, powered by our AI-innovation hub Kensho. For example, we introduced advanced analytics and GenAI functionality through Capital IQ Pro, which allows users to gain insights more efficiently from our data and automate their workflows. Just a few months after launching, more than 60,000 users have benefited from this innovation, and we expect that number to grow as adoption continues across our client base.

This image is a representation of organizational structure and leadership. The text highlights the development of both products and personnel, emphasizing the importance of a strong leadership team. The key feature is the mention of "previously announced appointments to our senior leadership team," implying a hierarchical structure with defined roles and responsibilities. The implication is that the organization prioritizes human capital and believes that a capable leadership team is crucial for achieving its strategic goals, specifically to "Power Global Markets." This suggests a top-down approach where leadership guides the organization towards its objectives.

![Image](ref_artifacts/image_000008_0e074313d9c970f675234b06c604ce851639f456560c72519aacbfa69f5fca93.png)

We have a culture of building leaders. It's a testament to our culture that half of our new leadership team is the result of promotions.

I am proud that S&amp;P Global is attracting top talent, too. In 2024 we announced Eric Aboaf as our new CFO. He brings a wealth of experience in the financial services sector and a strong record of the type of disciplined execution that is, and will continue to be, a hallmark of S&amp;P Global.

In 2024 we also benefited from several key transactions, including the acquisition of Visible Alpha. This business offers the most detailed and comprehensive consensus estimates available anywhere in the world. We frequently hear from customers that they could not do their jobs without it, and we are excited about its future.

## Strategic Growth Themes for 2025 and Beyond

The long-term prospects of S&amp;P Global are bright because we have aligned our businesses around growing global markets and five areas of strategic importance.

The key topics we discussed at our 2022 Investor Day-benchmarks, private markets, enterprise data, GenAI, and energy transition-remain our focus for investment in 2025 and beyond.

## Benchmarks

Geopolitical and macroeconomic risks are fueling an increasing need for trusted benchmarks across debt, equity, and commodity markets. S&amp;P Global sits in the heart of this trend.

class, fixed income, and thematic indices that become the basis for exchange-traded derivatives and other investment products.

Our index franchise is just one part of our compelling benchmarks story as users across sectors seek out transparent and trusted indices, credit ratings, and price assessments. Already, over $20 trillion is indexed or benchmarked to our indices, we rated $4.9 trillion in global debt in 2024, and we produce over 270 commodity benchmarks. Our focus is on expanding our existing benchmark franchises and growing our presence in private markets, digital assets, and other areas.

## Private Markets

Private markets are experiencing significant growth and transformation. Projections are for these markets to reach over $15 trillion this year and more than $18 trillion by 2027 1 . This growth is fueled by increasing demand from investors for high-yield, private credit, and private equity investments, driving assets into infrastructure, energy transition projects, and real estate.

S&amp;P Global provides market participants with the benchmarks, data, and insights needed to evaluate risks and identify opportunities. In 2024 our private market solutions business grew revenue by 25% to $535 million. We are confident about the opportunities to provide private market workflows, data, credit risk, and valuation assessments.

## Enterprise Data

We have unparalleled data sets. S&amp;P Global features over 1 trillion data points. This vast resource has grown 100x over the last five years with more growth ahead.

Take our leading position with S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. The shift from active management to passive investing has been one of the most transformative stories in the global asset industry over the past 40 years. We continue to see markets evolve, including the rise of active ETFs and digital wealth management. As dynamics change, we're supporting our clients with a range of solutions including multi-asset

With our newly established Enterprise Data Office, or EDO, we're working on ways to better connect our data so that it provides interesting and easier pathways to serve our clients.

This team has hit the ground running, and I am optimistic about the ways they can bring the full force of our data and technology to bear for customers of all kinds.

## GenAI

GenAI will have profound and accelerating effects across all sectors of the economy and in society. At S&amp;P Global, we have solid momentum using GenAI to be more productive, and we are increasingly incorporating it into our products and services.

Spark Assist, our internal GenAI copilot, is driving productivity and collaboration. Approximately 29,000 of our people have used it just a year after launch, and we have a library of 1,300 different prompts on the platform any of our people can select to help them with anything from writing Python code to researching securities data.

To improve the customer experience, this year our Commodity Insights division is launching an agent that allows users to surface our content directly into familiar Microsoft tools. And Kensho introduced a solution that is helping customers save time and resources by making our tabular data available through any GenAI tool.

This is just the beginning. We are building toward a future where our AI agents significantly improve our customers' workflows. In the future, agentic AI will streamline and execute complex, multistep processes, such as allowing investors to perform quantitative data analysis.

## Energy Transition

The world needs an energy system that's secure, affordable, and sustainable. We are well positioned to support customers, wherever they are on the journey from traditional energy production and consumption to renewables.

We recently made an exciting organizational change to help our clients as they navigate this transition. Moving our Sustainable1 organization within the Commodity Insights division allows us to merge our best thinking on this topic.

While the transition is expected to continue, we must also acknowledge the critical role that hydrocarbons will continue to play in the global energy mix and ensure we meet the evolving needs of our customers.

The trust they place in our solutions is evident. In 2024 our energy transition and sustainability revenue grew to $359 million, up 19% over the year prior. We expect our products will become even more valuable as the transition continues.

## People Forward

People sometimes ask me what excites me most about S&amp;P Global. The answer is our culture. Our core values of discovery, partnership, and integrity are front and center in everything we do. We have amazing technology capabilities and the best minds working on cutting-edge projects to Power Global Markets.

One of the first things I did as CEO was to affirm my commitment to fostering a culture where our people feel valued. Our focus is on empowering our people to grow and succeed. We call this our People Forward philosophy. In 2025 and in the years to come, we'll invest in the people and programs that are needed to maintain an innovative culture that can create sustainable value for all our stakeholders.

## Unlocking Opportunity Together

I want to thank our Board of Directors for the opportunity to serve our company. I also want to thank you for your support. There has never been a more exciting time to be at S&amp;P Global, and I am proud to lead our company into its next phase of growth. Let's unlock our potential together.

Sincerely,

Martina Cheung President and CEO

This figure represents a handwritten signature, likely intended for biometric authentication or document verification. The key features are the varying stroke widths, loop formations, and relative positioning of the characters. The signature exhibits a dynamic pressure profile, indicated by the changes in line thickness, and specific angular relationships between strokes. The overall shape and individual character formations are critical parameters. The engineering implication is that a robust biometric system must capture and analyze these subtle variations in pressure, angle, and shape to accurately authenticate the signature and differentiate it from forgeries. The system should be sensitive to both global features (overall shape) and local features (stroke characteristics) to achieve a high level of security and reliability.

## Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information

The Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ('GAAP'). The following is provided to supplement certain non-GAAP adjusted financial measures discussed in the letter to shareholders and the financial highlights section of this report (IFC-page 4) both as reported (on a GAAP basis) and as adjusted by excluding certain items (Non-GAAP) as explained below. The Company's non-GAAP measures include adjustments that reflect how management views our businesses. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information that, in the case of non-GAAP financial measures other than free cash flow, enables investors to better compare the Company's performance across periods, and management also uses these measures internally to assess the operating performance of its business, to assess performance for employee compensation purposes and to decide how to allocate resources. However, investors should not consider any of these non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the financial information that the Company reports.

## Operating Results - Reported vs. Adjusted Non-GAAP Financial Information

Twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

## Adjusted Operating Profit

1.  Objective: The table presents a reconciliation of operating profit to adjusted operating profit, comparing figures between 2024 and 2023.
2.  Layout: The table is structured with rows representing different components of profit calculation, including operating profit, non-GAAP adjustments, deal-related amortization, and adjusted operating profit. Columns provide the corresponding values for the years 2024 and 2023, along with the percentage change between the two periods.
3.  Significance: This table facilitates the analysis of financial performance by illustrating the impact of specific adjustments on the reported operating profit. It allows stakeholders to understand the underlying drivers of profitability and assess the comparability of financial results across different reporting periods.

## 2024

Revenue increased 14% driven by increases at all of our reportable segments, partially offset by a decrease at Engineering Solutions due to its sale on May 2, 2023. The increase at Ratings was driven by growth in both transaction revenue and non-transaction revenue. Transaction revenue increased primarily due to growth in corporate bond ratings revenue and bank loan ratings revenue driven by increased issuance volumes due to higher refinancing activity. Nontransaction revenue increased due to an increase in surveillance revenue and an increase in new entity credit ratings revenue. The increase at Market Intelligence was primarily due to subscription revenue growth for work flow solutions at Enterprise Solutions, data feed products within Data and Advisory Solutions, RatingsXpress ® , RatingsDirect ®  and Credit Analytics within Credit &amp; Risk Solutions and Market Intelligence Desktop products. Revenue growth at Commodity Insights was primarily due to continued demand for market data and market insights products. The increase at Indices was primarily due to higher asset-linked fees revenue, higher over-the-counter derivatives revenue, higher exchange-traded derivative revenue and higher data subscription revenue. The increase at Mobility was primarily due to new business growth within the Dealer business and strong underwriting volumes within the Financial business. Revenue at Market Intelligence was favorably impacted by the acquisition of Visible Alpha in May of 2024 and unfavorably impacted by the divestitures of Fincentric and the PrimeOne business in August of 2024 and November of 2024, respectively. Revenue at Commodity Insights was favorably impacted by the acquisition of World Hydrogen Leaders in May of 2024. Revenue at Mobility was favorably impacted by the acquisition of Market

Scan in February of 2023. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.

Operating profit increased 39%. Excluding the impact of a gain on dispositions in 2024 compared to a loss on dispositions, net in 2023 of 7 percentage points, higher IHS Markit merger costs in 2023 of 5 percentage points, a net acquisition-related benefit in 2024 compared to acquisition-related costs in 2023 of 4 percentage points, higher employee severance charges in 2023 of 3 percentage points, higher disposition-related costs in 2023 of 1 percentage point and higher lease impairments in 2023 of 1 percentage point, partially offset by higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions in 2024 of 2 percentage points and legal settlement costs in 2024 of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 21%. The increase was primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by increased incentives as a result of financial performance, higher compensation costs driven by annual merit increases and investments in strategic initiatives, and higher technology costs. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of 1 percentage point.

## 2023

Revenue increased 12% primarily due to the impact of the merger with IHS Markit; subscription revenue growth for Desktop products, RatingsXpress ® , RatingsDirect ® , and data feed products within Data &amp; Advisory Solutions at Market Intelligence; growth in corporate bond ratings revenue and bank loan ratings revenue due to higher refinancing activity and higher non-transaction revenue due to an increase in surveillance revenue and an increase in revenue at our Crisil subsidiary at Ratings; continued demand for market data and market insights products, higher conference revenue and an increase in sales

usage-based royalties from the licensing of our proprietary market data and price assessments to commodity exchanges at Commodity Insights; price increases and new business growth within the Dealer business as well as the favorable impact of the acquisition of Market Scan in February of 2023 at Mobility; and higher exchange-traded derivative revenue and higher data subscription revenue at Indices. These increases were partially offset by a decrease at Engineering Solutions due to its sale on May 2, 2023, a decrease in new entity credit ratings revenue at Ratings and lower over-the-counter derivatives revenue at Indices. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.

Operating profit decreased 19%. Excluding the unfavorable impact of a higher gain on dispositions in 2022 of 39 percentage points, higher acquisition-related costs in 2023 of 2 percentage points and higher amortization of intangibles in 2023 of 3 percentage points, partially offset by the impact of higher IHS Markit merger costs in 2022 of 8 percentage points, the impact of a S&amp;P Foundation grant in 2022 of 4 percentage points and higher employee severance charges in 2022 of 2 percentage points, operating profit increased 11%. The increase was primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by expenses associated with the merger with IHS Markit, higher compensation costs and increased incentives. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of 1 percentage point.

## 2024 Revenue by Type

1.  Context: The figure is a pie chart illustrating the percentage distribution of different revenue models. The primary objective is to visualize the relative contribution of each model to the total revenue.
2.  Deconstruction: The pie chart is divided into six segments, each representing a revenue model: Subscription (52%), Non-subscription/transaction (21%), Non-Transaction (13%), Asset-linked fees (7%), Sales usage-based royalties (3%), and Recurring variable (4%). The percentage value associated with each segment indicates its proportional contribution to the total revenue.
3.  Implication: The chart highlights that subscription-based revenue accounts for the largest portion (52%) of the total revenue, followed by non-subscription/transaction revenue (21%). The remaining revenue models contribute significantly less. This suggests that the system design should prioritize and optimize the subscription and non-subscription/transaction models to maximize revenue generation. The lower percentages of other models indicate that they may require further investigation or optimization to improve their contribution.

## 2024

Revenue increased 14% as compared to 2023. Subscription revenue increased in 2024 primarily due to growth in work flow solutions at Enterprise Solutions, data feed products within Data and Advisory Solutions, RatingsXpress ® , RatingsDirect ® and Credit Analytics within Credit &amp; Risk Solutions and Market Intelligence Desktop products at Market Intelligence, continued demand for Commodity Insights market data and market insights products and new business growth within the Dealer business and strong underwriting volumes within the Financial business at Mobility, partially offset by a decrease at Engineering Solutions due to its sale on May 2, 2023. Nonsubscription / transaction revenue increased primarily due to growth in corporate bond ratings revenue and bank loan ratings revenue driven by increased issuance volumes due to higher refinancing activity. Non-transaction revenue increased due to an increase in surveillance revenue and an increase in new entity credit ratings revenue. Asset linked fees increased at Indices primarily due to higher levels of assets under management for ETFs and mutual funds and higher over-the-counter derivatives revenue. The increase in sales-usage based royalties was driven by higher exchange-traded derivative revenue at Indices and the licensing of our proprietary market data to commodity exchanges at Commodity Insights. Recurring variable revenue at Market Intelligence increased due to increased volumes. Revenue at Market Intelligence was favorably impacted by the acquisition of Visible Alpha in May of 2024 and unfavorably impacted by the divestitures of Fincentric and the PrimeOne business in August of 2024 and November of 2024, respectively. Revenue at Commodity Insights was favorably impacted by the acquisition of World Hydrogen Leaders in May of 2024. Revenue at Mobility was favorably impacted by the acquisition of Market Scan in February of 2023. See 'Segment Review' below for further information.

The favorable impact of foreign exchange rates increased revenue by less than 1 percentage point. This impact refers to constant currency comparisons estimated by recalculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year.

## 2023

Revenue increased 12% as compared to 2022. Subscription revenue increased in 2023 primarily due to the impact of the merger with IHS Markit. Subscription revenue growth in Desktop products, Credit &amp; Risk Solutions and Data &amp; Advisory Solutions at Market Intelligence, continued demand for Commodity Insights market data and market insights products and higher data subscription revenue at Indices, partially offset by a decrease at Engineering Solutions due to its sale on May 2, 2023. Non-subscription / transaction revenue increased due to the impact of the merger with IHS Markit, growth in corporate bond ratings revenue and bank loan ratings revenue due to higher refinancing activity at Ratings and an increase in conference revenue at Commodity Insights, partially offset by a decrease at Engineering Solutions due to its sale on May 2, 2023. Non-transaction revenue increased due to an increase in surveillance revenue and an increase in revenue at our Crisil subsidiary, partially offset by a decrease in new entity credit ratings revenue. Asset linked fees remained relatively unchanged at Indices due to higher average levels of assets under management for ETFs, offset by product mix. The increase in sales-usage based royalties was primarily driven by higher exchange-traded derivative revenue at Indices and an increase in sales usage-based royalties from the licensing of our proprietary market data to commodity exchanges at Commodity Insights. Recurring variable revenue at Market Intelligence increased due to the impact of the merger with IHS Markit and fixed income new issuance volumes. See 'Segment Review' below for further information.

The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by less than 1 percentage point. This impact refers to constant currency comparisons estimated by recalculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year.

## 2024 Revenue by Geographic Area

1.  Context: The figure is a pie chart illustrating the percentage distribution of a quantity across different geographical regions. The primary objective is to show the relative proportions of this quantity attributed to the U.S., European Region, Asia, and the Rest of the World.
2.  Deconstruction: The pie chart is divided into four segments, each representing a region. The U.S. segment occupies 61% of the pie, the European Region 23%, Asia 10%, and the Rest of the World 6%. The percentages indicate the proportional contribution of each region to the total quantity being represented.
3.  Implication: The chart highlights that the U.S. accounts for the majority (61%) of the total quantity, significantly exceeding the contributions from other regions. This implies that design efforts should prioritize compatibility and optimization for the U.S. market or environment, given its dominant share. The European Region represents the next largest segment, suggesting it should also be considered in design and development, though to a lesser extent than the U.S.

## Total Expenses

The following tables provide an analysis by segment of our operating-related expenses and selling and general expenses for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:

1.  Objective: The table presents a comparative analysis of operating-related and selling & general expenses for the years 2024 and 2023, broken down by business segment and corporate unallocated expenses.
2.  Layout: The table is organized into rows representing different business segments (e.g., Market Intelligence, Ratings) and corporate unallocated expenses. Columns display the operating-related and selling & general expenses for both 2024 and 2023, expressed in millions of dollars. A final set of columns calculates the percentage change between the two years for each expense category.
3.  Significance: This table provides a clear view of expense trends across different business segments, enabling stakeholders to identify areas of significant cost changes, compare segment performance, and inform strategic decisions related to resource allocation and cost management. The inclusion of percentage change facilitates quick identification of segments with the most substantial expense fluctuations.

## Operating Profit

We consider operating profit to be an important measure for evaluating our operating performance and we evaluate operating profit for each of the reportable business segments in which we operate.

We internally manage our operations by reference to operating profit with economic resources allocated primarily based on each segment's contribution to operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as operating profit before Corporate Unallocated expense and Equity in Income on Unconsolidated Subsidiaries. Segment operating profit is not, however, a measure of financial performance under U.S. GAAP , and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner.

The table below reconciles segment operating profit to total operating profit:

1.  Objective: The table presents a financial overview of segment operating profit, corporate expenses, equity income, and total operating profit for the years 2022, 2023, and 2024.
2.  Layout: The table is structured with rows representing different segments (Market Intelligence, Ratings, Commodity Insights, Mobility, Indices, Engineering Solutions), followed by total segment operating profit, corporate unallocated expenses, equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries, and total operating profit. Columns display the financial figures (in millions) for each segment and total for the years 2024, 2023, and 2022, along with the percentage change between 2024 and 2023, and between 2023 and 2022.
3.  Significance: This table provides a comparative analysis of financial performance across different business segments and the overall company, enabling stakeholders to assess growth trends, identify key drivers of profitability, and understand the impact of corporate expenses and equity income on the total operating profit. It facilitates informed decision-making regarding resource allocation, investment strategies, and performance evaluation.

## 2024

## Segment Operating Profit

Segment operating profit increased 30% as compared to 2023. Excluding the impact of a net acquisition-related benefit in 2024 compared to acquisition-related costs in 2023 of 7 percentage points, higher employee severance costs in 2023 of 3 percentage points, higher IHS Markit merger costs in 2023 of 3 percentage points, a higher gain on dispositions in 2024 of 1 percentage point, partially offset by higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions in 2024 of 3 percentage points, legal settlement costs in 2024 of 2 percentage points and a statutorily required bonus accrual adjustment in 2024 of 1 percentage point, segment operating profit increased 22%. The increase was primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by increased incentives as a result of financial performance, higher compensation costs driven by annual merit increases and higher technology costs. See 'Segment Review' below for further information.

## Corporate Unallocated Expense

Corporate Unallocated expense includes costs for corporate functions, select initiatives, unoccupied office space and Kensho,

included in selling and general expenses. Corporate Unallocated expense decreased 39% compared to 2023.

## 2023

## Other (Income) Expense, net

Other (income) expense, net primarily includes the net periodic benefit cost for our retirement and post retirement plans. Other income, net for 2024 was $25 million, other expense, net in 2023 was $15 million and other income, net for 2022 was $70 million. During 2023 and 2022, lump sum withdrawals exceeded the combined total anticipated annual service and interest cost of our U.S. retirement plan and U.K. plan, respectively, triggering the recognition of a non-cash pre-tax settlement charge of $23 million and $13 million, respectively. Excluding amortization of intangibles from acquisitions in 2024 of $6 million and pre-tax settlement charges in 2023 and 2022, other income, net was $31 million, $9 million, and $83 million for 2024, 2023, 2022, respectively. The increase in other income, net in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to an increase in net periodic benefit cost in 2024 and gains on our mark-to-market investments in 2024 compared to losses in 2023. The decrease in other income, net in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to losses on our mark-to-market investments in 2023 compared to gains in 2022.

## Interest Expense, net

Interest expense, net decreased $37 million in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to a benefit from our net investment hedge program, reduced expense related to commercial paper borrowings in 2024 and higher interest income from invested cash. Interest expense, net increased $30 million in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to the issuance of $750 million 5.25% senior notes in September of 2023 and incremental

expense related to commercial paper borrowings. See Note 5 Debt to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.

## Loss on Extinguishment of Debt, net

In 2022, we recognized an $8 million loss on extinguishment of debt which includes a tender premium paid to tendering note holders in accordance with the terms of the tender offer of $142 million, partially offset by a $134 million non-cash write-off related to the fair market value step up premium on extinguished debt.

## Provision for Income Taxes

Our effective tax rate was 21.5%, 21.2% and 25.1% for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Fluctuation in tax rates by year is primarily due to tax charge on merger related divestitures and change in mix of income by jurisdiction.

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') introduced an international tax framework under Pillar Two which includes a global minimum tax of 15%. This framework has been implemented by several jurisdictions, including jurisdictions in which we operate, with effect from January 1, 2024, and many other jurisdictions, including jurisdictions in which we operate, are in the process of implementing it. The effect of enacted Pillar Two taxes has been included in the results disclosed and did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. The Company continues to monitor jurisdictions that are expected to implement Pillar Two in the future, and it is in the process of evaluating the potential impact of the enactment of Pillar Two by such jurisdictions on its consolidated financial statements.

1 2024 includes employee severance charges of $77 million, gain on dispositions of $59 million, IHS Markit merger costs of $36 million, a net acquisition-related benefit of $12 million and Executive Leadership Team transition costs of $3 million. 2023 includes employee severance charges of $90 million, acquisition-related costs of $69 million, IHS Markit merger costs of $49 million, a gain on disposition of $46 million, an asset impairment of $5 million and an asset write-off of $1 million. 2022 includes a gain on dispositions of $1.8 billion, employee severance charges of $90 million, IHS Markit merger costs of $35 million and acquisitionrelated costs of $2 million. 2024, 2023 and 2022 include amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $591 million, $561 million and $474 million, respectively.

## 2024

Revenue increased 6% primarily due to subscription revenue growth for work flow solutions at Enterprise Solutions, data feed products within Data and Advisory Solutions, RatingsXpress ® , RatingsDirect ®  and Credit Analytics within Credit &amp; Risk Solutions and Market Intelligence Desktop products, partially offset by increased cancellations during the year ended December 31, 2024. Revenue growth was favorably impacted by the acquisition of Visible Alpha in May of 2024 and unfavorably impacted by the divestitures of Fincentric and the PrimeOne business in August of 2024 and November of 2024, respectively. An increase in recurring variable revenue due to increased volumes also contributed to revenue growth. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.

Operating profit increased 22%. Excluding the impact of a net acquisition-related benefit in 2024 compared to acquisitionrelated costs in 2023 of 16 percentage points, a higher gain on dispositions in 2024 of 2 percentage points, higher employee severance charges in 2023 of 2 percentage points, higher IHS Markit merger costs in 2023 of 2 percentage points and an asset impairment in 2023 of 1 percentage point, partially offset by higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions in 2024 of 6 percentage points, operating profit increased 5% primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by higher compensation costs driven by annual merit increases, increased incentives, increased technology costs and expenses associated with the acquisition of Visible Alpha. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of 3 percentage points.

## 2023

Revenue increased 15% primarily due to the impact of the merger with IHS Markit. Subscription revenue growth for Market Intelligence Desktop products, RatingsXpress ® , RatingsDirect ® , and data feed products within Data and Advisory Solutions also contributed to revenue growth. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.

Operating profit decreased 71%. Excluding the impact of a higher gain on dispositions in 2022 of 79 percentage points, higher amortization of intangibles in 2023 of 4 percentage points, higher acquisition-related costs of 3 percentage points and higher IHS Markit merger costs in 2023 of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 16%  primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by expenses associated with the merger with IHS Markit, higher compensation costs and increased incentives. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of 1 percentage point.

## Industry Highlights and Outlook

Market Intelligence continues to focus on developing key product offerings in growth areas such as energy transition and sustainability and growing new products and product features by leveraging technology investments. Product launches and innovation continued at Market Intelligence in 2024 with the introduction of several new products and product features leveraging technology investments.

## Legal and Regulatory Environment

The market for data, analytical capabilities and research services is intensely competitive, ranging from established firms to fast evolving market disruptors. Market Intelligence competes domestically and internationally based on a number of factors, including the quality and range of its data, analytical capabilities, research services, client service, reputation, price, geographic scope, and technological innovation.

Market Intelligence is subject to global regulation, particularly in the European Union, the U.K., the U.S. and increasingly so in other jurisdictions.  Several laws and regulations in the European Union, the U.K. and the U.S. have been adopted but not yet implemented, or have been proposed or are being considered, to which Market Intelligence, or its clients, will or may become subject, including laws and regulations related to pricing providers, sustainability, credit rating data, data privacy and cyber security and technology and organizational resilience.  For example, the EU passed the Digital Operational Resilience Act in December 2022 ('DORA'), which became effective January 17, 2025. DORA imposes operational resilience and cyber security standards and obligations, including technical and organizational standards and responsibilities which require technology and/or organizational investment, upon (i) many Market Intelligence financial market clients, who aim to pass such obligations onto vendors like Market Intelligence, and (ii) information and communications technology providers designated by the EU as 'Critical Third Party Providers,' which in certain instances includes Market Intelligence.  The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority has published a consultation on establishing a UK Operational Resilience Framework, which if adopted may impact our Market Intelligence financial market clients who may look to pass such obligations onto vendors like Market Intelligence.  In addition, from time to time, government and self-regulatory agencies in jurisdictions where we operate conduct market studies on our markets, which may result in the imposition of remedies that impact our business.

At this time, the exact impact on Market Intelligence of any such recently adopted or proposed laws or regulations, or market studies, remains uncertain, but they could increase the regulatory exposure of Market Intelligence and are anticipated to increase the costs and legal risks relating to certain of Market Intelligence's activities. Furthermore such laws and regulations may adversely affect the ability of Market Intelligence to provide its products and services, or result in changes in the demand for its products and services. If Market Intelligence fails to comply with any such laws or regulations, it could be subject to significant litigation, civil or criminal penalties, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions or fines. Regulatory developments may also present commercial opportunities to Market Intelligence to develop further or different services to enable better compliance by its clients.

For a further discussion of the legal and regulatory environment in our Market Intelligence business, see Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## RATINGS

Ratings is an independent provider of credit ratings, research, and analytics, offering investors and other market participants information, ratings and benchmarks. Credit ratings are one of several tools investors can use when making decisions about purchasing bonds and other fixed income investments. They are opinions about credit risk and our ratings express our opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer, such as a corporation or state or city government, to meet its financial obligations in full and on time. Our credit ratings can also relate to the credit quality of an individual debt issue, such as a corporate or municipal bond, and the relative likelihood that the issue may default.

Ratings disaggregates its revenue between transaction and non-transaction. Transaction revenue primarily includes fees associated with:

## 2024

Revenue increased 31%, with a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates of less than 1 percentage point. Transaction revenue increased primarily due to growth in corporate bond ratings revenue and bank loan ratings revenue driven by increased issuance volumes due to higher refinancing activity. An increase in structured finance revenue driven by increased collateralized loan obligations ('CLOs') issuance also contributed to transaction revenue growth. Non-transaction revenue increased primarily due to an increase in surveillance revenue and an increase in new entity credit ratings revenue. Transaction and non-transaction revenue also benefited from improved contract terms across product categories.

Operating profit increased 45%. Excluding the impact of legal settlement costs in 2024 of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 46% due to revenue growth, partially offset by increased incentives as a result of financial performance and higher compensation costs driven by annual merit increases and additional headcount. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of 1 percentage point.

- -ratings related to new issuance of corporate and government debt instruments, as well as structured finance debt instruments; and
- -bank loan ratings.

Non-transaction revenue primarily includes fees for surveillance of a credit rating, annual fees for customer relationship-based pricing programs, fees for entity credit ratings and global research and analytics at Crisil. Non-transaction revenue also includes an intersegment royalty charged to Market Intelligence for the rights to use and distribute content and data developed by Ratings. Royalty revenue for 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $162 million, $154 million and $143 million, respectively.

## 2023

Revenue increased 9%, with a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates of less than 1 percentage point. Transaction revenue increased due to growth in corporate bond ratings revenue primarily driven by increased high-yield and investmentgrade issuance volumes due to higher refinancing activity. An increase in bank loan ratings revenue driven by increased issuance volumes due to higher refinancing activity also contributed to transaction revenue growth. Non-transaction revenue increased primarily due to an increase in surveillance revenue and an increase in revenue at our Crisil subsidiary, partially offset by a decrease in new entity credit ratings revenue. Transaction and non-transaction revenue also benefited from improved contract terms across product categories.

Operating profit increased 11%. Excluding the impact of higher employee severance costs in 2022 of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 10% due to revenue growth, partially offset by higher current-year compensation costs and prior-year write-downs in incentive compensation as result of financial performance.

## Billed Issuance Volumes

We monitor billed issuance volumes regularly within Ratings. Billed issuance excludes items that do not impact transaction revenue, such as issuance from frequent issuer programs, unrated debt, and most international public finance to more effectively correlate issuance activity to movements in transaction revenue.

The following table provides billed issuance levels based on Ratings' internal data feeds for the years ended December 31:

1.  Objective: The table presents a comparative analysis of billed issuance across different categories and time periods.
2.  Layout: The table is structured with rows representing different types of billed issuance, including "Investment-grade," "High-yield," and "Other," as well as the "Total" billed issuance. Columns display the billed issuance amounts (in billions of dollars) for the years 2024, 2023, and 2022, followed by columns showing the percentage change in billed issuance from 2023 to 2024 and from 2022 to 2023.
3.  Significance: This table provides a concise overview of trends in billed issuance across different categories, enabling stakeholders to assess growth rates, compare performance across categories, and understand the overall market dynamics over the specified time frame. It is useful for financial analysis, strategic planning, and investment decision-making.

Note - Totals presented may not sum due to rounding.

* Includes Corporates, Financial Services and Infrastructure.

** Includes Bank Loans, Structured Finance and Government.

Billed issuance was up in 2024 as continued favorable market conditions drove issuers to capitalize on tightening borrowing spreads. Refinancing continued to drive high-yield, while M&amp;A and other non-refinancing activity also drove billed issuance increases in investment grade and bank loans. Structured finance billed issuance increases were driven primarily by new CLO issuance.

## Industry Highlights and Outlook

Revenue increased in 2024 primarily driven by an increase in corporate bond ratings revenue, bank loan ratings revenue and an increase in non-transaction revenue. Increased issuance volumes due to higher refinancing activity drove increases in corporate bond ratings revenue and bank loan ratings revenue. An increase in structured finance revenue driven by increased CLO issuance also contributed to transaction revenue growth.

Energy transition and sustainability initiatives and international expansion in emerging markets continue to be areas of focus for Ratings.

## Legal and Regulatory Environment

## General

Ratings and many of the securities that it rates are subject to extensive regulation in both the U.S. and in other countries, and therefore existing and proposed laws and regulations can impact the Company's operations and the markets in which it operates. Additional laws and regulations have been adopted but not yet implemented or have been proposed or are being considered. In addition, in certain countries, governments may provide financial or other support to locally-based rating agencies. For example, governments may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers. We have reviewed the new laws, regulations and rules which have been adopted and we have implemented, or are planning to implement, changes as required. We do not believe that such new laws, regulations or rules will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Other laws, regulations and rules relating to credit rating agencies are from time to time considered by local, national, foreign and multinational bodies and are likely to continue to be considered in the future, including, for example, provisions seeking to reduce regulatory and investor reliance on credit ratings or to increase competition among credit rating agencies, provisions regarding remuneration and rotation of credit rating agencies, and liability standards applicable to credit rating agencies. Similarly, other laws, regulations and rules are being adopted or considered or are likely to be considered in the future that may impact ancillary and other services provided by Ratings in addition to its credit rating products and services, for example regulatory oversight regimes for ESG ratings providers such as the EU regulation on the transparency and integrity of ESG rating activities that was adopted by the European Parliament and Council in November 2024 (the 'EU ESG Ratings Regulation'). The impact on us of the adoption of any such laws, regulations or rules remains uncertain, but could increase the costs and legal risks relating to Ratings' activities, or adversely affect our ability to compete and/or our remuneration, or result in changes in the demand for our products and services.

In the normal course of business both in the U.S. and abroad, Ratings (or the legal entities comprising Ratings) are defendants

in numerous legal proceedings and are often the subject of government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries (including market studies). Many of these proceedings, investigations and inquiries relate to the ratings activity of Ratings and are or have been brought by purchasers of rated securities. In addition, various government and self-regulatory agencies frequently make inquiries and conduct investigations into Ratings' compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Any of these proceedings, investigations or inquiries (including market studies) could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties, activity restrictions or negative impacts on our cash flow, which could adversely impact our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position.

## U.S.

The businesses conducted by our Ratings segment are, in certain cases, regulated under the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006 (the 'Reform Act'), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the 'Dodd Frank Act'), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 'Exchange Act') and/or the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which our Ratings segment conducts business. The financial services industry is subject to the potential for increased regulation in the U.S.

S&amp;P Global Ratings is a credit rating agency that is registered with the SEC as a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization ('NRSRO'). The SEC first began informally designating NRSROs in 1975 for use of their credit ratings in the determination of capital charges for registered brokers and dealers under the SEC's Net Capital Rule. The Reform Act created a new SEC registration system for rating agencies that choose to register as NRSROs. Under the Reform Act, the SEC is given authority and oversight of NRSROs and can censure NRSROs, revoke their registration or limit or suspend their registration in certain cases. The rules implemented by the SEC pursuant to the Reform Act, the Dodd Frank Act and the Exchange Act address, among other things, prevention or misuse of material non-public information, conflicts of interest, documentation and assessment of internal controls, and improving transparency of ratings performance and methodologies. The public portions of the current version of S&amp;P Global Ratings' Form NRSRO are available on S&amp;P Global Ratings' website.

## European Union

In the European Union ('EU'), the credit rating industry is registered and supervised through a pan-European regulatory framework which is a compilation of three sets of legislative actions. In 2009, the European Parliament passed a regulation ('CRA1') that established an oversight regime for the credit rating industry in the EU, which became effective in 2010. CRA1 requires the registration, formal regulation and periodic inspection of credit rating agencies operating in the EU. Ratings was granted registration in October of 2011. In January of 2011, the EU established the European Securities and Markets Authority ('ESMA'), which, among other things, has direct supervisory responsibility for the registered credit rating industry throughout the EU.

Additional rules augmenting the supervisory framework for credit rating agencies went into effect in 2013. Commonly referred to as CRA3, these rules, among other things:

- -impose various additional procedural requirements with respect to ratings of sovereign issuers;
- -require member states to adopt laws imposing liability on credit rating agencies for an intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by the applicable regulations;
- -impose mandatory rotation requirements on credit rating agencies hired by issuers of securities for ratings of resecuritizations, which may limit the number of years a credit rating agency can issue ratings for such securities of a particular issuer;
- -impose restrictions on credit rating agencies or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed; and
- -impose additional procedural and substantive requirements on the pricing of services.

Since January 2025, Ratings has been subject in the EU to new operational resilience and cyber security standards under the Digital Operational Resilience Act, including technical and organizational standards and responsibilities which may require technology and/or organizational investment.

The EU ESG Ratings Regulation will start applying mid-2026 and could impose new regulatory requirements regarding some of Ratings' ancillary and other services.

The financial services industry is subject to the potential for increased regulation in the EU.

## United Kingdom

Following its exit from the European Union, the United Kingdom ('U.K.') established a credit rating agencies oversight regime with rules that closely mirror those in place in the EU. Ratings was granted registration with the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority ('FCA') on January 1, 2021. It is possible that the rules applicable to credit rating agencies in the U.K. will diverge from those in the EU in the future as a result of changes to one or the other legislative regime or differing approaches by the FCA and ESMA.

## Other Jurisdictions

Outside of the U.S., the EU and the U.K., regulators and government officials have also been implementing formal oversight of credit rating agencies. Ratings is subject to regulations in most of the foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and continues to work closely with regulators globally to promote the global consistency of regulatory requirements. Regulators in additional countries may introduce new regulations in the future.

- -Upstream Data &amp; Insights - includes exploration &amp; production data and insights, software and analytics; and
- -Advisory &amp; Transactional Services - includes consulting services, conferences, events and global trading services.

Commodity Insights' revenue is generated primarily through the following sources:

- -Subscription revenue - primarily from subscriptions to our market data and market insights (price assessments, market reports and commentary and analytics) along with other information products and software term licenses;
- -Sales usage-based royalties - primarily from licensing our proprietary market price data and price assessments to commodity exchanges; and
- -Non-subscription revenue - conference sponsorship, consulting engagements, events, and perpetual software licenses.

See Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion including information on the merger with IHS Markit.

## 2024

Revenue increased 10% primarily due to continued demand for market data and market insights products driven by expanded product offerings to our existing customers under enterprise use contracts. An increase in sales usage-based royalties from the licensing of our proprietary market data to commodity exchanges due to increased trading volumes for Platts based contracts across all commodity sectors and higher consulting revenue also contributed to revenue growth. Revenue was favorably impacted by the acquisition of World Hydrogen Leaders in May of 2024. All four business lines contributed to revenue growth in 2024 with the Price Assessments, Energy &amp; Resources Data &amp; Insights and Advisory &amp; Transactional Services businesses being the most significant drivers, followed by the Upstream Data &amp; Insights business. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.

Operating profit increased 20%. Excluding the impact of higher IHS Markit merger costs in 2023 of 5 percentage points and higher employee severance charges in 2023 of 3 percentage points, operating profit increased 12%. The increase was primarily due to revenue growth partially offset by higher compensation costs driven by annual merit increases, higher incentives, investment in strategic initiatives and expenses associated with the acquisition of World Hydrogen Leaders. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.

## 2023

Revenue increased 16% primarily due to the impact of the merger with IHS Markit, continued demand for market data and market insights products driven by expanded product offerings to our existing customers under enterprise use contracts and higher conference revenue. An increase in sales usage-based royalties from the licensing of our proprietary market data to commodity exchanges mainly due to increased trading volumes also contributed to revenue growth. The Energy &amp; Resources Data &amp; Insights, Price Assessments and Upstream Data &amp; Insights businesses continue to be the most significant revenue streams, followed by the Advisory &amp; Transactional Services business. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.

Operating profit increased 19%. Excluding the impact of higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions in 2023 of 6 percentage points and higher IHS Markit merger costs in 2023 of 3 percentage points, partially offset by higher employee severance charges in 2022 of 6 percentage points, operating profit increased 16%. The increase was primarily due to revenue growth partially offset by expenses associated with the merger with IHS Markit, higher compensation costs, increased incentives, an increase in costs related to the Commodity Insights conferences in 2023 and an increase in strategic investments. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of 1 percentage point.

## Industry Highlights and Outlook

In 2024, sustained demand for market data and market insights products, an increase in sales usage-based royalties from the licensing of our proprietary market data and price assessments to commodity exchanges mainly due to increased trading volumes, higher consulting revenue and the favorable impact of the acquisition of World Hydrogen Leaders in May of 2024 contributed to revenue growth. Commodity Insights continues to focus on developing new products and product features leveraging technology investments and developing key product offerings in energy transition and sustainability.

## Legal and Regulatory Environment

Commodity Insights' price assessment business is subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny.  Commodity Insights is subject to commodity benchmark regulation in the EU (the 'EU Benchmark Regulation') and the U.K. (the 'U.K. Benchmark Regulation'), as well as increasing regulation in other jurisdictions. Commodity Insights has obtained authorization and is now supervised by the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets in the Netherlands under the EU Benchmark Regulation, and it will likely need to take similar steps in other jurisdictions including the United Kingdom when the transitional period under the EU Benchmark Regulation (and its equivalent under the U.K. Benchmark Regulation) ends, as well as in jurisdictions outside of Europe implementing similar legislation.

The EU's package of legislative measures called the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Regulation (collectively 'MiFID II') have applied in all EU Member States since 2018. MiFID II includes provisions that, among other things: (i) impose new conditions and requirements on the licensing of benchmarks and provide for non-discriminatory access to exchanges and clearing houses; (ii) modify the categorization and treatment of certain classes of derivatives; (iii) expand the categories of trading venue that are subject to regulation; (iv) require the unbundling of investment research and direct how asset managers pay for research either out of a research payment account or from a firm's profits; and (v) provide for the mandatory trading of certain derivatives on exchanges (complementing the mandatory derivative clearing requirements in the E.U. Market Infrastructure Regulation of 2011). MiFID II and potential subsequent amendments may result in changes to the manner in which the Commodity Insights business licenses its price assessments. MiFID II and the Market Abuse Regulation may impose additional regulatory burdens on Commodity Insights activities in the EU over time, but their impact on, and costs to, the Company have not yet been substantive.

In October of 2012, IOSCO issued its Principles for Oil Price Reporting Agencies ('PRA Principles'), which are intended to enhance the reliability of oil price assessments referenced in derivative contracts subject to regulation by IOSCO members. Commodity Insights has aligned its operations with the PRA Principles and, as recommended by IOSCO in its final report on the PRA Principles, has aligned to the PRA Principles for other commodities for which it publishes benchmarks.

From time to time, government and self-regulatory agencies in jurisdictions where we operate conduct market studies on our markets, which may result in the imposition of remedies that impact our business.

Other laws, regulations and rules are being adopted or considered or are likely to be considered in the future that may impact Commodity Insights, for example regulatory oversight regimes for ESG ratings providers such as the EU regulation on

the transparency and integrity of ESG rating activities that was adopted by the European Parliament and Council in November 2024 (the 'EU ESG Ratings Regulation').  The EU ESG Ratings Regulation will start applying mid-2026 and could impose new regulatory requirements regarding some of Commodity Insights' ancillary and other services. The impact on us of the adoption of any such laws, regulations or rules remains uncertain, but could increase the costs and legal risks relating to Commodity Insights' activities, or adversely affect our ability to compete and/ or our remuneration, or result in changes in the demand for our products and services.

For a further discussion of the legal and regulatory environment in our Commodity Insights business, see Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## MOBILITY

Mobility is a leading provider of solutions serving the full automotive value chain including vehicle manufacturers (Original Equipment Manufacturers or OEMs), automotive suppliers, mobility service providers, retailers, consumers, and finance and insurance companies.

In February of 2023, we completed the acquisition of Market Scan Information Systems Inc. ('Market Scan'), a leading provider of automotive pricing and incentive intelligence, including Automotive Payments as a Service TM  and its powerful payment calculation engine. The addition of Market Scan to Mobility enabled the integration of detailed transaction intelligence in areas that are complementary to existing services for dealers, OEMs, lenders, and other market participants. The acquisition of Market Scan is not material to our consolidated financial statements.

Mobility includes the following business lines:

- -Dealer - includes analytics to predict future buyers, targeted marketing, and vehicle history data to allow people to shop, buy, service and sell used cars;
- -Manufacturing - includes insights, forecasts and advisory services spanning the entire automotive value chain, from product planning to marketing, sales and the aftermarket; and
- -Financial  - includes reports and data feeds to support lenders and insurance companies.

Mobility's revenue is generated primarily through the following sources:

- -Subscription revenue - Mobility's core information products provide critical information and insights to all global OEMs, most of the world's leading suppliers, and the majority of North American dealerships. Mobility operates across both the new and used car markets. Mobility provides data and insight on future vehicles sales and production, including detailed forecasts on technology and vehicle components; supplies car makers and dealers with market reporting products, predictive analytics and marketing automation software; and supports dealers with vehicle history reports, used car listings and service retention services. Mobility also sells a range of services to financial institutions, to support their marketing, insurance underwriting and claims management activities; and
- -Non-subscription revenue - One-time transactional sales of data that are non-cyclical in nature - and that are usually tied to underlying business metrics such as OEM marketing spend or safety recall activity - as well as consulting and advisory services.

The Mobility business was acquired in connection with the merger with IHS Markit on February 28, 2022 and financial results are included since the date of acquisition.

1 2024 includes employee severance charges of $7 million, IHS Markit merger costs of $4 million, acquisition-related costs of $2 million and a liability write-off of $1 million. 2023 includes employee severance charges of $9 million, IHS Markit merger costs of $3 million and acquisition-related costs of $2 million. 2022 includes an acquisition-related benefit of $14 million, employee severance charges of $4 million and IHS Markit merger costs of $3 million. 2024, 2023 and 2022 include amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $303 million, $301 million and $241 million, respectively.

## 2024

Revenue increased 8% primarily due to growth within the Dealer and Financial businesses driven by continued new business growth within the Dealer business and strong underwriting volumes within the Financial business. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in non-subscription revenue in the Manufacturing business due to lower recall activity and marketing services. Revenue at Mobility was favorably impacted by the acquisition of Market Scan in February of 2023.   Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point.

Operating profit increased 20%. Excluding the impact of higher employee severance charges in 2023 of 19 percentage points, a liability write-off in 2024 of 4 percentage points and higher acquisition-related costs in 2023 of 4 percentage points, partially offset by higher amortization of intangibles in 2024 of 8 percentage points and higher IHS Markit merger costs in 2024 of 8 percentage points, operating profit increased 9% driven by revenue growth, partially offset by higher compensation costs driven by annual merit increases, higher incentives, an increase in strategic investments and expenses associated with the acquisition of Market Scan. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point.

## 2023

Revenue increased 30% primarily due to the impact of the merger with IHS Markit, price increases and new business growth within the Dealer business as well as the favorable impact of the acquisition of Market Scan in February of 2023. Increases within the Financial business due to strong underwriting volumes and the Manufacturing business due to strong recall activity and uptick in marketing solutions also contributed to revenue growth. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.

Operating profit increased 22%. Excluding the impact of higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions in 2023 of 5 percentage points, an acquisition-related benefit in 2022 of 1 percentage point and higher employee severance charges in 2023 of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 29% driven by revenue growth, partially offset by the impact of the merger with IHS Markit, higher compensation costs, increased incentives, higher technology costs and expenses associated with the acquisition of Market Scan. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of 2 percentage points.

## Industry Highlights and Outlook

In 2024, Mobility delivered revenue growth within the Dealer and Financial businesses. The Manufacturing business was unfavorably impacted by lower non-subscription revenue primarily due to weakness in recall activity.

Mobility continues to focus on multiple growth opportunities including: evolving our forecasting business to encompass new technologies and new forms of mobility; the transformation to hybrid electric vehicles and digital retail; enabling consumers to shop, buy, service and sell used cars; and, leveraging the power of S&amp;P Global to develop products for financial markets and the industry's transition towards sustainable mobility.

## Legal and Regulatory Environment

Certain types of information that our Mobility business collects, compiles, stores, uses, transfers, publishes and/or sells is subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions in which it operates. There is an increasing public concern regarding, and resulting regulations of, privacy, data, and consumer protection issues. Certain laws and regulations to which our Mobility business is subject pertain to personally identifiable information relating to individuals. Such laws and regulations constrain the collection, use, storage, and transfer of personally identifiable information, and impose other obligations with which we must comply. Other regulation geared at consumer protection such as the Federal Trade Commission's CARS Rule announced in December 2023 sets a framework to ensure transparency throughout the vehicle buying and leasing process and could therefore impact Mobility's products and services. If our Mobility business fails to comply with these laws or regulations, we could be subject to significant litigation and civil or criminal penalties (including monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions or fines) in one or more jurisdictions and reputational damage resulting in the loss of data, brand equity and business. To conduct our operations, our Mobility business also moves data across national borders and consequently can be subject to a variety of evolving and developing laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and data security in an increasing number of jurisdictions. Many jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, such as the U.S. Driver's Privacy Protection Act ('DPPA'), the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (the 'GDPR'), the cyber-security law adopted by China in 2017, the separate consumer privacy laws in California and other states in the U.S., as well as other jurisdictions considering imposing such restrictions. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently, and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which our Mobility business operates, which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us. It is possible that our Mobility business could be prohibited or constrained from collecting or disseminating certain types of data or from providing certain products or services. If our Mobility business fails to comply with these laws or regulations, we could be subject to significant litigation, civil or criminal penalties, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions or fines in one or more jurisdictions. For example, a failure to comply with the GDPR could result in fines up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues or in the case of a DPPA violation, U.S. courts may award liquidated damages of $2,500 per individual's personal information. Additional risks are presented by the evolving landscape related to sanctions and export control laws. The landscape related to these laws is evolving rapidly and presents compliance challenges to all businesses covered by these laws. In addition, from time to time, government and self-regulatory agencies in jurisdictions where we operate conduct market studies on our markets, which may result in the imposition of remedies that impact our business.

1 2024 includes IHS Markit merger costs of $4 million, a loss on disposition of $1 million and employee severance charges of $1 million. 2023 includes employee severance charges of $5 million, a gain on disposition of $4 million and IHS Markit merger costs of $4 million. 2022 includes a gain on disposition of $52 million, employee severance charges of $14 million and IHS Markit merger costs of $2 million. 2024, 2023 and 2022 include amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $36 million, $36 million and $31 million, respectively.

## 2024

Revenue at Indices increased 16% primarily due to an increase in asset linked fees revenue driven by higher levels of assets under management ('AUM') for ETFs and mutual funds, higher over-the-counter derivatives revenue, higher exchange-traded derivative revenue driven by continued strength in trading volume and higher data subscription revenue. Average levels of AUM for ETFs increased 33% to $3.836 trillion and ending AUM for ETFs increased 33% to $4.389 trillion compared to 2023. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.

Operating profit increased 19%. Excluding the impact of a loss on disposition in 2024 compared to a gain on disposition in 2023 of 4 percentage points, partially offset by higher employee severance charges in 2023 of 3 percentage points, operating profit increased 18% due to revenue growth partially offset by higher compensation costs driven by annual merit increases, higher incentives and an increase in strategic investments. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point.

## 2023

Revenue at Indices increased 5% primarily due to higher exchange-traded derivative revenue driven by continued strength in average trading volume and higher data subscription revenue, partially offset by lower over-the-counter derivatives revenue. Asset linked fees remained relatively unchanged at Indices due to higher average levels of AUM for ETFs, offset by product mix. Average levels of AUM for ETFs increased 8% to $2.895 trillion and ending AUM for ETFs increased 27% to $3.303 trillion compared to 2022. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.

Operating profit remained unchanged, decreasing less than 1%. Excluding the impact of a higher gain on dispositions in 2022 of 5 percentage points and higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions in 2023 of 1 percentage point, partially offset by  higher employee severance charges in 2022 of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 5% due to revenue growth partially offset by increased compensation costs and incentives. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.

## Industry Highlights and Outlook

Revenue increased in 2024 primarily due to an increase in asset linked fees revenue driven by higher levels of AUM for ETFs and mutual funds, higher over-the-counter derivatives revenue, higher exchange-traded derivative revenue driven by continued strength in trading volume and higher data subscription revenue. Indices continues to be a leading index provider for the ETF market space.

Key strategic growth areas, including thematic and factor indices and energy transition and sustainability, continue to be areas of focus for Indices and contributed to revenue growth in 2024.

## Legal and Regulatory Environment

The financial benchmarks industry is subject to specific benchmark regulation in the European Union (the 'EU Benchmark Regulation'), the United Kingdom (the 'U.K. Benchmark Regulation'), and Australia (the 'Australia Benchmark Regulation'). Various other jurisdictions, including the United States, India, Canada and South Africa, are also considering the regulation of financial benchmarks through new or existing regimes.

Although they vary in scope, the requirements of the EU Benchmark Regulation, the U.K. Benchmark Regulation and the Australian Benchmark Regulation are similar. Indices currently maintains a benchmark administrator in both the Netherlands (authorized by the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM)) for its benchmark activities in the European Union and in the United Kingdom (authorized by the Financial Conduct Authority) for its benchmark activities in the United Kingdom. The Australian Benchmark Regulation requires a license from the Australian Securities and Investment Commission ('ASIC'), which Indices has obtained. These benchmark regulations have and may continue to cause increased operating obligations, exposure, compliance risk, and costs of doing business for Indices.

In July of 2013, IOSCO issued its Principles for Financial Benchmarks (the 'Financial Benchmark Principles'), intended to promote the reliability of financial benchmarks. The Financial Benchmark Principles address governance, benchmark quality and accountability mechanisms, including with regard to the indices published by Indices. Indices has taken steps to align its governance regime, control framework and operations with the Financial Benchmark Principles and engages an independent auditor to perform an annual reasonable assurance review of its adherence to the Financial Benchmark Principles.

From time to time, government and self-regulatory agencies in jurisdictions where we operate conduct market studies on our markets, which may result in the imposition of remedies that impact our business.

For a further discussion of the legal and regulatory environment in our Indices business, see Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS

As of May 2, 2023, we completed the sale of Engineering Solutions, a provider of engineering standards and related technical knowledge, and the results are included through that date.

1 2023 includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $1 million. 2022 includes employee severance charges of $4 million and amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $35 million.

## 2023

Revenue decreased 59% as a result of the sale of Engineering Solutions. Operating profit increased 24%. Excluding the impact of higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions in 2022 of 77 percentage points and employee severance charges in 2022 of 10 percentage points, operating profit decreased 63% as a result of the sale of Engineering Solutions. As of May 2, 2023, we completed the sale of Engineering Solutions and the results are included through that date. The Engineering Solutions business was acquired in connection with the merger with IHS Markit on February 28, 2022 and the financial results are included since the date of acquisition through May 2, 2023.

## Liquidity And Capital Resources

We continue to maintain a strong financial position. Our primary source of funds for operations is cash from our businesses and our core businesses have been strong cash generators. In 2025, cash on hand, cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facility are expected to be sufficient to meet any additional operating and recurring cash needs in the short term and into the foreseeable future. We use our cash for a variety of needs, including but not limited to: ongoing investments in our businesses, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends, repayment of debt, capital expenditures and investment in our infrastructure.

## Cash Flow Overview

Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash were $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Year ended December 31,

1. Objective: The table presents a summary of net cash flow activity, categorized by operating, investing, and financing activities, over a three-year period.
2. Layout: The table is structured with rows representing the three primary categories of cash flow activities: operating, investing, and financing. Columns display the net cash flow amounts, expressed in millions, for each activity across three consecutive years (2022, 2023, and 2024). Negative values, enclosed in parentheses, indicate net cash outflows or cash used for that activity.
3. Significance: This table provides a concise overview of the company's cash flow performance, enabling analysis of trends in each activity category over time. It facilitates comparative analysis of cash generation and usage, supporting informed decision-making related to financial strategy, investment planning, and operational efficiency. The data allows stakeholders to assess the company's ability to generate cash from its core operations, manage investments, and fund its financing obligations.

| (in millions)                    | 2024    | 2023    | 2022     |
|----------------------------------|---------|---------|----------|
| Net cash provided by (used for): |         |         |          |
| Operating activities             | $5,689  | $3,710  | $2,603   |
| Investing activities             | (255)   | 562     | 3,628    |
| Financing activities             | (4,998) | (4,280) | (11,326) |

In 2024, free cash flow increased to $5.3 billion compared to $3.3 billion in 2023 primarily due to an increase in cash provided by operating activities as discussed below. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders. Capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects. See 'Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information' below for a reconciliation of cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow.

## Operating activities

Cash provided by operating activities increased to $5.7 billion in 2024 as compared to $3.7 billion in 2023. The increase is mainly due to higher operating results in 2024, proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swaps in 2024 and higher tax payments in 2023.

Cash provided by operating activities increased to $3.7 billion in 2023 as compared to $2.6 billion in 2022. The increase is mainly due to higher operating results in 2023, higher IHS Markit merger costs in 2022, higher taxes paid on divestitures in 2022 and a grant payment to the S&amp;P Global Foundation in 2022.

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') introduced an international tax framework under Pillar Two which includes a global minimum tax of 15%. This framework has been implemented by several jurisdictions, including jurisdictions in which we operate, with effect from January 1, 2024, and many other jurisdictions, including jurisdictions in which we operate, are in the process of implementing it. The effect of enacted Pillar Two taxes has been included in the results disclosed and did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. The Company continues to monitor jurisdictions that are expected to implement Pillar Two in the future, and it is in the process of evaluating the potential impact of the enactment of Pillar Two by such jurisdictions on its consolidated financial statements.

## Investing activities

Our cash outflows from investing activities are primarily for acquisitions and capital expenditures, while cash inflows are primarily proceeds from dispositions.

Cash used for investing activities was $0.3 billion for 2024 compared to cash provided by investing activities of $0.6 billion for 2023, primarily due to higher cash proceeds received in 2023 related to the disposition of Engineering Solutions.

Cash provided by investing activities was $0.6 billion for 2023 as compared to $3.6 billion in 2022, primarily due to higher cash proceeds received from dispositions in 2022 related to the dispositions of CUSIP Global Services, Oil Price Information Services, the Leveraged Commentary and Data business and a related family of leveraged loan indices, and the Base Chemicals business.

Refer to Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

## Financing activities

Our cash outflows from financing activities consist primarily of share repurchases, dividends to shareholders and repayments of short-term and long-term debt, while cash inflows are primarily attributable to the borrowing of short-term and long-term debt.

Cash used for financing activities increased to $5.0 billion in 2024 from $4.3 billion in 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to proceeds received from the $750 million issuance of senior note in 2023.

Cash used for financing activities decreased to $4.3 billion in 2023 from $11.3 billion in 2022. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in cash used for share repurchases in 2023.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, we received a total of 6.7 million shares, including 0.2 million shares received in February of 2024 related to our November 13, 2023 accelerated share repurchase ('ASR') agreement, resulting in $3.3 billion of cash used to purchase shares. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we received a total of 8.6 million shares, including 0.4 million shares received in February of 2023 related to our December 2, 2022 ASR agreement, resulting in $3.3 billion of cash used to purchase shares. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we purchased 33.5 million shares for $12.0 billion of cash. See Note 9 Equity to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for information related to our ASR agreements.

On June 22, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of 30 million shares (the '2022 Repurchase Program'), which was approximately 9% of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time. On January 29, 2020, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of 30 million shares (the '2020 Repurchase Program'), which was approximately 12% of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time. As of December 31, 2024, 12.0 million shares remained available under the 2022 Repurchase Program and the 2020 Repurchase Program was completed.

## Additional Financing

On December 17, 2024, we entered into a revolving $2.0 billion five-year credit agreement that will terminate on December 17, 2029 (our 'credit facility'). This credit facility replaced our revolving $2.0 billion five-year credit facility that was scheduled to terminate on April 26, 2026 (our 'previous credit facility'). The previous credit facility was canceled immediately after the new credit facility became effective. There were no outstanding borrowings under the previous credit facility when it was replaced.

We have the ability to borrow a total of $2.0 billion through our commercial paper program, which is supported by our credit facility. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had no outstanding commercial paper.

Commitment fees for the unutilized commitments under the credit facility and applicable margins for borrowings thereunder are linked to the Company achieving three environmental sustainability performance indicators related to emissions, tested annually. We currently pay a commitment fee of 7 basis points. The credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and customary events of default. The occurrence of an event of default could result in an acceleration of the obligations under the credit facility.

The only financial covenant required under our credit facility is that our indebtedness to cash flow ratio, as defined in our credit facility, was not greater than 4 to 1, and this covenant level has never been exceeded.

## Dividends

On January 28, 2025, the Board of Directors approved a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.96 per share.

1 Our debt obligations are described in Note 5 Debt to our consolidated financial statement.

2 See Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our operating lease obligations.

3 Other consists primarily of commitments for unconditional purchase obligations in contracts for information-technology outsourcing and certain enterprise-wide information-technology software licensing and maintenance.

As of December 31, 2024, we had $325 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. We have excluded the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits from our contractual obligations table because, until formal resolutions are reached, reasonable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities are not practicable.

As of December 31, 2024, we have recorded $4.2 billion for our redeemable noncontrolling interest in our S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC partnership discussed in Note 9 Equity to our consolidated financial statements.  Specifically, this amount relates to the put option under the terms of the operating agreement of S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC, whereby, after December 31, 2017, CME Group and CME Group Index Services LLC ('CGIS') has the right at any time to sell, and we are obligated to buy, at least 20% of their share in S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC.

We have excluded this amount from our contractual obligations table because we are uncertain as to the timing and the ultimate amount of the potential payment we may be required to make.

We make contributions to our pension and postretirement plans in order to satisfy minimum funding requirements as well as additional contributions that we consider appropriate to improve the funded status of our plans. During 2024, we contributed $11 million to our retirement plans. Expected employer contributions in 2025 are $11 million and $2 million for our retirement and postretirement plans, respectively. In 2025, we may elect to make additional non-required contributions depending on investment performance and the pension plan status. See Note 7 Employee Benefits to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

## Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders. Capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects. Our cash flow provided by operating activities is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure to free cash flow.

We believe the presentation of free cash flow allows our investors to evaluate the cash generated from our underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. We use free cash flow to conduct and evaluate our business because we believe it typically presents a more conservative measure of cash flows since capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders are considered a necessary component of ongoing operations. Free cash flow is useful for management and investors because it allows management and investors to evaluate the cash available to us to prepay debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments and repurchase stock.

The presentation of free cash flow is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Free cash flow, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. The following table presents a reconciliation of our cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow:

1.  Objective: The table presents a comparative analysis of the company's cash flow activities, categorized by operating, investing, and financing activities, over a three-year period.
2.  Layout: The table is structured with rows representing specific cash flow components, such as "Cash provided by operating activities," "Capital expenditures," "Cash provided by (used for) investing activities," and "Cash used for financing activities." Columns display the corresponding values for each component for the years 2024, 2023, and 2022, all expressed in millions of dollars. Additionally, the table includes columns showing the percentage change in each cash flow component from 2023 to 2024 and from 2022 to 2023, providing a year-over-year comparison.
3.  Significance: This table provides a concise overview of the company's cash flow performance, enabling stakeholders to assess the trends and drivers of cash generation and usage across different business activities. It facilitates the analysis of the company's financial health, investment strategies, and financing decisions, supporting informed decision-making by investors, management, and other interested parties.

## Critical Accounting Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.

On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, business combinations, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, pension plans, incentive compensation and stock-based compensation, income taxes, contingencies and redeemable noncontrolling interests. We base our estimates on historical experience, current developments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under these circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that cannot readily be determined from other sources. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates.

Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it required assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to them in this MD&amp;A.

We believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:

## Revenue recognition

Under ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. See Note 1 Accounting Policies t o our consolidated financial statements for further information.

## Business combinations

We apply the purchase method of accounting to our business combinations. All of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and contingent consideration are allocated based on their estimated fair values. Fair value determinations involve significant estimates and assumptions about several highly subjective variables, including future cash flows, discount rates, and expected business performance. There are also different valuation models and inputs for each component, the selection of which requires considerable judgment. Our estimates and assumptions may be based, in part, on the availability of listed market prices or other transparent market data. These determinations will affect the amount of amortization expense recognized in future periods. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe are reasonable, but recognize that the assumptions are inherently uncertain. Depending on the size of the purchase price of a particular acquisition, the mix of intangible assets acquired, and expected business performance, the purchase price allocation could be materially impacted by applying a different set of assumptions and estimates.

## Allowance for doubtful accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts reserve methodology is based on historical analysis, a review of outstanding balances and current conditions, and by incorporating data points that provide indicators of future economic conditions including forecasted industry default rates and industry index benchmarks. In determining these reserves, we consider, amongst other factors, the financial condition and risk profile of our customers, areas of specific or concentrated risk as well as applicable industry trends or market indicators. The impact on operating profit for a one percentage point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts is approximately $29 million.

We incorporate the forecasted impact of future economic conditions into our allowance for doubtful accounts measurement process. In times of economic turmoil, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods. Based on our current outlook these assumptions are not expected to significantly change in 2025.

## Accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets (including other intangible assets)

We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Upon such an occurrence, recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to current forecasts of undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. For long-lived assets held for sale, assets are written down to fair value, less cost to sell. Fair value is determined based on market evidence, discounted cash flows, appraised values or management's estimates, depending upon the nature of the assets.

## Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets was $35.8 billion and $35.7 billion, respectively. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.

## Goodwill

As part of our annual impairment test of our five reporting units, we initially perform a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount. Reporting units are generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. Our qualitative assessment included, but was not limited to, consideration of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, cash flows, changes in key Company personnel and our share price. If, based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, no quantitative impairment test is performed. Conversely, if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its respective carrying amount, we perform a quantitative impairment test. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the difference is recognized as an impairment charge. For 2024, based on our qualitative assessments, we determined that it is more likely than not that our reporting units' fair values were greater than their respective carrying amounts.

## Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

We evaluate the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets by first performing a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired. If, based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired, no quantitative impairment test is performed. Conversely, if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired, a quantitative impairment test is performed. If necessary, an impairment analysis is performed using the income approach to estimate the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. If the intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Significant judgments inherent in these analyses include estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates, royalty rates and long-term growth rate assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for this indefinite-lived intangible asset and could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our financial position and results of operations.

We performed our impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and concluded that no impairment existed for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

## Retirement plans and postretirement healthcare and other benefits

Our employee pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances, including compensation increases, long-term return on pension plan assets, discount rates and other factors. In determining such assumptions, we consult with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate. In accordance with relevant accounting standards, if actual results differ from our assumptions, such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated remaining lifetime of the plan participants. While we believe that the assumptions used in these calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could affect the expense and liabilities related to our pension and other postretirement benefits.

The following is a discussion of some significant assumptions that we make in determining costs and obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits:

- -Discount rate assumptions are based on current yields on high-grade corporate long-term bonds.
- -The expected return on assets assumption is calculated based on the plan's asset allocation strategy and projected market returns over the long-term.

Our discount rate and return on asset assumptions used to determine the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost on our U.S. retirement plans are as follows:

1.  Objective: The table presents key financial assumptions used in the valuation of retirement and post-retirement benefit plans.
2.  Layout: The table is organized into two primary sections: "Retirement Plans" and "Postretirement Plans." Within each section, data is presented for three consecutive years (2023, 2024, and 2025). The rows display the discount rate and the return on assets assumptions as of January 1st of each year. The 2025 values are bolded.
3.  Significance: This table provides a concise overview of the financial assumptions used in actuarial valuations. It allows for a quick comparison of these assumptions across different plan types and over time, facilitating trend analysis and risk assessment related to the company's benefit obligations.

|                  | Retirement Plans   | Retirement Plans   | Retirement Plans   | Postretirement Plans   | Postretirement Plans   | Postretirement Plans   |
|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| January 1        | 2025               | 2024               | 2023               | 2025                   | 2024                   | 2023                   |
| Discount rate    | 5.74%              | 5.27%              | 5.63%              | 5.57%                  | 5.18%                  | 5.52%                  |
| Return on assets | 6.25%              | 6.00%              | 6.00%              |                        |                        |                        |

As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $1.0 billion in pension benefit obligation for our U.S. retirement plans. A 0.25 percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would result in an estimated decrease or increase to the accumulated benefit obligation of approximately $25 million. An increase or decrease of 1 percentage point in the expected rate of return on plan assets would result in a decrease or increase of approximately $13 million to 2025 pension expense.

## Stock-based compensation

Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period, which typically is the vesting period. Stock-based compensation is classified as both operatingrelated expense and selling and general expense in our consolidated statements of income.

## Income taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in interest expense and operating expense, respectively.

Judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial performance of the operation that is recording a net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions, and we are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities. We believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events. It is possible that tax examinations will be settled prior to December 31, 2025. If any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period, we would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits.

As of December 31, 2024, we have approximately $8.5 billion of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, of which $4.7 billion is reinvested indefinitely in our foreign operations.

## Contingencies

We are subject to a number of lawsuits and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. We recognize a liability for such contingencies when both (a) information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (b) the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on an analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Because many of these matters are resolved over long periods of time, our estimate of liabilities may change due to new developments, changes in assumptions or changes in our strategy related to the matter. When we accrue for loss contingencies and the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range, we record its best estimate within the range. We disclose an estimated possible loss or a range of loss when it is at least reasonably possible that a loss may have been incurred.

## Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest

The fair value component of the redeemable noncontrolling interest in Indices business is based on a combination of an income and market valuation approach. Our income and market valuation approaches may incorporate Level 3 fair value measures for instances when observable inputs are not available. The more significant judgmental assumptions used to estimate the value of the S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture include an estimated discount rate, a range of assumptions that form the basis of the expected future net cash flows (e.g., the revenue growth rates and operating margins), and a company specific beta. The significant judgmental assumptions used that incorporate market data, including the relative weighting of market observable information and the comparability of that information in our valuation models, are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $4.2 billion in redeemable noncontrolling interest in the Indices business on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The ultimate amount paid for the redeemable noncontrolling interest in Indices business could be significantly different because the redemption amount depends on the future results of operations of the business.

As of December 31, 2024, the weighted average cost of capital used in the Company's income analysis to estimate the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest was 10.6%. A 0.25 percentage point increase or decrease in the weighted average cost of capital would decrease or increase the redemption value by approximately $108 million or $81 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, the terminal growth rate used in the Company's income analysis to estimate the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest was 2.2%. A 0.25 percentage point increase or decrease in the terminal growth rate would increase or decrease the redemption value by approximately $27 million or $54 million, respectively.

## Recent Accounting Standards

See Note 1 Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of recent accounting standards. We do not expect these recent accounting standards to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity in future periods.

## Forward-Looking Statements

This report contains 'forward-looking statements,' as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

## Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income

1.  **Objective:** The table presents a reconciliation of net income to comprehensive income attributable to S&P Global Inc. for the years 2022, 2023, and 2024.
2.  **Layout:** The table is structured with rows detailing components of other comprehensive income, including foreign currency translation adjustments, pension and postretirement benefit plans, and unrealized gains on cash flow hedges, each with its associated income tax effect. These components are aggregated to arrive at comprehensive income, from which amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests are subtracted. The columns provide comparative financial data for the three consecutive years, allowing for trend analysis.
3.  **Significance:** This table is crucial for understanding the full scope of S&P Global Inc.'s financial performance beyond net income. It provides stakeholders with a detailed view of items that are not reflected in the income statement but still impact the company's overall equity and financial position. The table facilitates a more comprehensive assessment of profitability and investment decisions by revealing the impact of various non-operating factors on the company's financial health over time.

## Consolidated Balance Sheets

1.  Objective: Comparative balance sheet presenting a financial snapshot of assets, liabilities, and equity for two consecutive fiscal years.
2.  Layout: The table is structured into three primary sections: Assets, Liabilities, and Equity. Within each section, line items detail specific asset categories (e.g., current assets, property and equipment), liability types (e.g., current liabilities, long-term debt), and equity components (e.g., common stock, retained earnings). Each line item presents monetary values for the current and prior year, enabling direct year-over-year comparison. Subtotals are provided for key groupings like total current assets, total liabilities, and total equity.
3.  Significance: This balance sheet provides a structured overview of the company's financial position at two distinct points in time. It facilitates analysis of changes in asset composition, debt levels, and equity structure, supporting assessments of financial health, solvency, and investment performance. The comparative format enables trend identification and informs strategic decision-making related to capital allocation, risk management, and shareholder value.

## Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows

1.  Objective: The table presents a consolidated statement of cash flows, detailing the sources and uses of cash for a company over a three-year period.
2.  Layout: The table is structured with a single column of descriptive line items and three columns of numerical data representing the years 2024, 2023, and 2022. The rows are grouped into three primary sections: Operating Activities, Investing Activities, and Financing Activities, with subtotals calculated for each section. Additional rows display the effect of exchange rate changes on cash, the net change in cash, cash balances at the beginning and end of each year, and cash paid for interest and income taxes.
3.  Significance: This table provides a comprehensive view of the company's cash flow performance, enabling stakeholders to assess its ability to generate cash, manage investments, and fund operations. It is crucial for analyzing liquidity, solvency, and financial flexibility, supporting informed decision-making by investors, creditors, and management.

## Consolidated Statements of Equity

1.  Objective: Summary of changes in equity accounts over time.
2.  Layout: The table presents a chronological analysis of equity account balances, spanning from December 31, 2021, to December 31, 2024. The rows detail specific transactions or events impacting equity, such as comprehensive income, dividends, share repurchases, employee stock plans, and adjustments to noncontrolling interests. Columns categorize these impacts across various equity components, including common stock, additional paid-in capital, retained income, accumulated other comprehensive loss, treasury stock, total SPGI equity, and non-controlling interests, culminating in a total equity figure.
3.  Significance: This table provides a clear reconciliation of equity account movements, enabling stakeholders to understand the drivers of changes in equity over the specified period. It is valuable for financial statement analysis, investment decision-making, and assessing the company's capital structure and shareholder value.

## 1. Accounting Policies

## Nature of operations

S&amp;P Global Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the 'Company,' the 'Registrant,' 'we,' 'us' or 'our') is a provider of credit ratings, benchmarks, analytics and workflow solutions in the global capital, commodity and automotive markets. The capital markets include asset managers, investment banks, commercial banks, insurance companies, exchanges, trading firms and issuers; the commodity markets include producers, consumers, traders and intermediaries within energy, chemicals, shipping, metals, carbon and agriculture; and the automotive markets include manufacturers, suppliers, dealerships, service shops and consumers.

Our operations consist of five reportable segments: S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence ('Market Intelligence'), S&amp;P Global Ratings ('Ratings'), S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights ('Commodity Insights'), S&amp;P Global Mobility ('Mobility') and S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices ('Indices').

- -Market Intelligence is a global provider of multi-assetclass data and analytics integrated with purpose-built workflow solutions.
- -Ratings is an independent provider of credit ratings, research, and analytics, offering investors and other market participants information, ratings and benchmarks.
- -Commodity Insights is a leading independent provider of information and benchmark prices for the commodity and energy markets.

## Revenue Recognition

Under ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.

## Subscription revenue

Subscription revenue at Market Intelligence is primarily derived from distribution of data, valuation services, analytics, third party research, and credit ratings-related information through both feed and web-based channels. Subscription revenue at Market Intelligence also includes software and hosted product offerings which provide maintenance and continuous access to our platforms over the contract term. Subscription revenue at Commodity Insights is primarily from subscriptions to our market data and market insights (price assessments, market reports and commentary and analytics) along with other information products and software term licenses. Subscription revenue at Mobility is primarily derived from products that provide data and insight on future vehicles sales and production, including detailed forecasts on technology and vehicle components; supply car makers and dealers with market reporting products, predictive analytics and marketing automation software; and support dealers with vehicle history reports, used car listings and service retention solutions. Subscription revenue at Mobility also include a range of services to financial institutions, to support their marketing, insurance underwriting and claims management activities. Subscription revenue at Indices is derived from the contracts for underlying data of our indexes to support our customers' management of index funds, portfolio analytics, and research. Subscription revenue at Engineering Solutions was primarily from subscriptions to our Product Design offerings providing standards, codes and specifications; applied technical reference; engineering journals, reports, best practices, and other vetted technical reference; and patents and patent applications.

For subscription products and services, we generally provide continuous access to dynamic data sets and analytics for a defined period, with revenue recognized ratably as our performance obligation to provide access to our data and analytics is progressively fulfilled over the stated term of the contract.

## Non-transaction revenue

Non-transaction revenue at Ratings primarily includes fees for surveillance of a credit rating, annual fees for customer relationship-based pricing programs, fees for entity credit ratings and global research and analytics at Crisil. Nontransaction revenue also includes an intersegment revenue elimination of $186 million, $177 million and $169 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, mainly consisting of the royalty charged to Market Intelligence for the rights to use and distribute content and data developed by Ratings.

For non-transaction revenue related to Rating's surveillance services, we continuously monitor factors that impact the creditworthiness of an issuer over the contractual term with revenue recognized to the extent that our performance obligation is progressively fulfilled over the term contract. Because surveillance services are continuously provided throughout the term of the contract, our measure of progress towards fulfillment of our obligation to monitor a rating is a time-based output measure with revenue recognized ratably over the term of the contract.

## Non-subscription / Transaction revenue

Transaction revenue at our Ratings segment primarily includes fees associated with:

- -ratings related to new issuance of corporate and government debt instruments; as well as structured finance instruments; and
- -bank loan ratings.

Transaction revenue is recognized at the point in time when our performance obligation is satisfied by issuing a rating on our customer's instruments and when we have a right to payment and the customer can benefit from the significant risks and rewards of ownership.

Non-subscription revenue at Market Intelligence is primarily related to certain advisory, pricing conferences and events, and analytical services. Non-subscription revenue at Mobility include one-time transactional sales of data that are non-cyclical in nature - and that are usually tied to underlying business metrics such as vehicle manufacturers marketing spend or safety recall activity - as well as consulting and advisory services. Non-subscription revenue at Commodity Insights is primarily related to conference sponsorship, consulting engagements, events, and perpetual software licenses. Nonsubscription revenue at Engineering Solutions was primarily from retail transaction and consulting services.

## Asset-linked fees

Asset-linked fees at Indices are primarily related to royalties payments based on the value of assets under management in our customers exchange-traded funds and mutual funds.

For asset-linked products and services, we provide licenses conveying continuous access to our index and benchmarkrelated intellectual property during a specified contract term. Revenue is recognized when the extent that our customers have used our licensed intellectual property can be quantified. Recognition of revenue for our asset-linked fee arrangements is subject to the 'recognition constraint' for usage-based royalty payments because we cannot reasonably predict the value of the assets that will be invested in index funds structured using our intellectual property until it is either publicly available or when we are notified by our customers. Revenue derived from an asset-linked fee arrangement is measured and recognized when the certainty of the extent of its utilization of our index products by our customers is known.

## Sales usage-based royalties

Sales usage-based royalty revenue at our Indices segment is primarily related to trading based fees from exchange-traded derivatives. Sales and usage-based royalty revenue at our Commodity Insights segment is primarily related to licensing of its proprietary market price data and price assessments to commodity exchanges.

For sales usage-based royalty products and services, we provide licenses conveying the right to continuous access to our intellectual property over the contract term, with revenue recognized when the extent of our license's utilization can be quantified, or more specifically, when trading volumes are known and publicly available to us or when we are notified by our customers. Recognition of revenue of fees tied to trading volumes is subject to the recognition constraint for a usage-based royalty promised by our customers in exchange for the license of our intellectual property, with revenue recognized when trading volumes are known.

## Recurring variable revenue

Recurring variable revenue at Market Intelligence represents revenue from contracts for services that specify a fee based on, among other factors, the number of trades processed, assets under management, or the number of positions valued.

## Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations

Our contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. Revenue relating to agreements that provide for more than one performance obligation is recognized based upon the relative fair value to the customer of each service component as each component is earned. The fair value of the service components are determined using an analysis that considers cash consideration that would be received for instances when the service components are sold separately. If the fair value to the customer for each service is not objectively determinable, we make our best estimate of the services' stand-alone selling price and record revenue as it is earned over the service period.

## Receivables

We record a receivable when a customer is billed or when revenue is recognized prior to billing a customer. For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual period.

## Contract Assets

Contract assets include unbilled amounts from when the Company transfers service to a customer before a customer pays consideration or before payment is due. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, contract assets were $69 million and $75 million, respectively, and are included in accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets.

## Unearned Revenue

We record unearned revenue when cash payments are received in advance of our performance. The increase in the unearned revenue balance for the year ended December 31, 2024 is primarily driven by cash payments received in advance of

satisfying our performance obligations, offset by $3.2 billion of revenues recognized that were included in the unearned revenue balance at the beginning of the period.

## Remaining Performance Obligations

Remaining performance obligations represent the transaction price of contracts for work that has not yet been performed. As of December 31, 2024, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $4.8 billion. We expect to recognize revenue on approximately sixty percent and eighty-five percent of the remaining performance obligations over the next 12 and 24 months, respectively, with the remainder recognized thereafter.

We do not disclose the value of unfulfilled performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts where revenue is a usage-based royalty promised in exchange for a license of intellectual property.

## Costs to Obtain a Contract

We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that the costs associated with certain sales commission programs are incremental to the costs to obtain contracts with customers and therefore meet the criteria to be capitalized. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were $291 million and $234 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and are included in prepaid and other current assets and other non-current assets on our consolidated balance sheets. The capitalized asset will be amortized over a period consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates, calculated based on the customer term and the average life of the products and services underlying the contracts which has been determined to be approximately 5 years. The expense is recorded within selling and general expenses in the consolidated statements of income.

We expense sales commissions when incurred if the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling and general expenses.

## Equity in Income on Unconsolidated Subsidiaries

The Company holds an investment in a 50/50 joint venture arrangement with shared control with CME Group that combines each company's post-trade services into a joint venture, OSTTRA. The joint venture provides trade processing and risk mitigation operations and incorporates CME Group's optimization businesses (Traiana, TriOptima, and Reset) and the Company's MarkitSERV business. The combination is intended to increase operating efficiencies of both the company's business to more effectively service clients with enhanced platforms and services for OTC markets across interest rate, FX, equity, and credit asset classes. Our share of earnings or losses are recognized in Equity in income on unconsolidated subsidiaries in our consolidated statements of income.

## Other (Income) Expense, net

The components of other (income) expense, net for the years ended December 31 are as follows:

1. Objective: The table presents a summary of specific financial components impacting net income, including periodic benefit costs, investment gains/losses, and other income/expenses.
2. Layout: The table is structured with rows representing different categories of financial activity: "Other components of net periodic benefit cost," "Net (gain) loss from investments," and "Other (income) expense, net." Columns display the corresponding financial values in millions of dollars for the years 2024, 2023, and 2022, allowing for year-over-year comparison.
3. Significance: This table provides a concise overview of key financial elements beyond core operational revenues and expenses. It is useful for analyzing trends in benefit costs, investment performance, and other non-operating income/expense items, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing the company's overall financial performance across the specified years.

## Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations

## Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale

We classify a disposal group to be sold as held for sale in the period in which all of the following criteria are met: management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the disposal group; the disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such disposal group; an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the disposal group have been initiated; the sale of the disposal group is probable, and transfer of the disposal group is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year, except if events or circumstances beyond our control extend the period of time required to sell the disposal group beyond one year; the disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.

A disposal group that is classified as held for sale is initially measured at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. Any loss resulting from this measurement is recognized in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. Conversely, gains are not recognized on the sale of a disposal group until the date of sale.

The fair value of a disposal group less any costs to sell is assessed each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale and any subsequent changes are reported as an adjustment to the carrying value of the disposal group, as long as the new carrying value does not exceed the carrying value of the disposal group at the time it was initially classified as held for sale. Upon determining that a disposal group meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, the Company reports the assets and liabilities of the disposal group as held for sale in the current period in our consolidated balance sheets.

## Discontinued Operations

In determining whether a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity is required to be presented as a discontinued operation, we make a determination whether the disposal represents a strategic shift that had, or will have, a major effect on our operations and financial results. A component of an entity comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished both operationally and for financial reporting purposes. If we conclude that the disposal represents a strategic shift, then the results of operations of the group of assets being disposed of (as well as any gain or loss on the disposal transaction) are aggregated for separate presentation apart from our continuing operating results in the consolidated financial statements.

## Principles of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries and our share of earnings or losses of joint ventures and affiliated companies under the equity method of accounting. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The Company applies the guidelines set forth in Topic 810 of the ASC in assessing its interests in variable interest entities to decide whether to consolidate an entity. The Company has reviewed the potential variable interest entities and determined that there are no consolidation requirements under Topic 810 of the ASC.

## Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

## Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include ordinary bank deposits and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that consist primarily of money market funds with unrestricted daily liquidity and fixed term time deposits. Such investments and bank deposits are stated at cost, which approximates market value, and were $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These investments are not subject to significant market risk.

## Restricted cash

Cash that is subject to legal restrictions or is unavailable for general operating purposes is classified as restricted cash. We had no restricted cash included in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. Restricted cash included in our consolidated balance sheet was $1 million as of December 31, 2023.

## Short-term investments

Short-term investments are securities with original maturities greater than 90 days that are available for use in our operations in the next twelve months. The short-term investments, primarily consisting of certificates of deposit and mutual funds, are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value, which is estimated based on the net asset value of these investments. Interest and dividends are recorded in income when earned.

## Accounts receivable

Credit is extended to customers based upon an evaluation of the customer's financial condition. Accounts receivable, which include billings consistent with terms of contractual arrangements, are recorded at net realizable value.

## Allowance for doubtful accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts reserve methodology is based on historical analysis, a review of outstanding balances and current conditions, and by incorporating data points that provide indicators of future economic conditions including forecasted industry default rates and industry index benchmarks. In determining these reserves, we consider, amongst other factors, the financial condition and risk profile of our customers, areas of specific or concentrated risk as well as applicable industry trends or market indicators.

## Capitalized technology costs

We capitalize certain software development and website implementation costs. Capitalized costs only include incremental, direct costs of materials and services incurred to develop the software after the preliminary project stage is completed, funding has been committed and it is probable that the project will be completed and used to perform the function intended. Incremental costs are expenditures that are out-ofpocket to us and are not part of an allocation or existing expense base. Software development and website implementation costs are expensed as incurred during the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs are amortized from the year the software is ready for its intended use over its estimated useful life, three to seven years, using the straight-line method. Periodically, we evaluate the amortization methods, remaining lives and recoverability of such costs. Capitalized software development and website implementation costs are included in other non-current assets and are presented net of accumulated amortization. Gross capitalized technology costs were $338 million and $303 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Accumulated amortization of capitalized technology costs was $204 million and $194 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

## Fair Value

Certain assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value and classified within a fair value hierarchy based on inputs used when measuring fair value. We have foreign exchange forward contracts, cross currency and interest rate swaps that are adjusted to fair value on a recurring basis.

Other financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity and highly liquid nature of these instruments. The fair value of our

long-term debt borrowings were $10.0 billion and $10.3 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and was estimated based on quoted market prices.

## Accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets (including other intangible assets)

We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Upon such an occurrence, recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to current forecasts of undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. For long-lived assets held for sale, assets are written down to fair value, less cost to sell. Fair value is determined based on market evidence, discounted cash flows, appraised values or management's estimates, depending upon the nature of the assets.

## Leases

We determine whether an arrangement meets the criteria for an operating lease or a finance lease at the inception of the arrangement. We have operating leases for office space and equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 11 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to 12 years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases early. We consider these options in determining the lease term used to establish our right-of use ('ROU') assets and associated lease liabilities. We sublease certain real estate leases to third parties which mainly consist of operating leases for space within our offices.

Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expenses for these leases on a straight line-basis over the lease term in operatingrelated expenses and selling and general expenses.

Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Our future minimum based payments used to determine our lease liabilities include minimum based rent payments and escalations. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.

## Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter each year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We have five reporting units with goodwill that are evaluated for impairment.

We initially perform a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred or exist that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount. If, based on our evaluation we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, no quantitative impairment test is performed. Conversely, if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than their respective carrying amounts we perform a quantitative impairment test.

When conducting our impairment test to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at the reporting unit level, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill. Fair value of the reporting units are estimated using the income approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted free cash flow ('DCF') analyses and are corroborated using the market approach, which incorporates the use of revenue and earnings multiples based on market data. The DCF analyses are based on the current operating budgets and estimated long-term growth projections for each reporting unit. Future cash flows are discounted based on a market comparable weighted average cost of capital rate for each reporting unit, adjusted for market and other risks where appropriate. In addition, we analyze any difference between the sum of the fair values of the reporting units and our total market capitalization for reasonableness, taking into account certain factors including control premiums. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the difference is recognized as an impairment charge.

We evaluate the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets by first performing a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired. If, based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired, no quantitative impairment test is performed. Conversely, if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired, a quantitative impairment test is performed. If necessary, an impairment analysis is performed using the income approach to estimate the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. If the intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

Significant judgments inherent in these analyses include estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates, royalty rates and long-term growth rate assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset and could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our financial position and results of operations.

We performed our impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and concluded that no impairment existed for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

## Equity Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries

Equity investments for which we exercise significant influence, but do not have control over the investee, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Unrealized gains and losses are included in other (income) expense, net. Equity investments for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are primarily accounted for under the measurement alternative. Under the measurement alternative, the carrying value is measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and are recorded in other (income) expense, net. Our equity investments are included in Equity investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in our consolidated balance sheets. Our share of earnings or losses are recognized in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income. We periodically evaluate all our equity investments for impairment.

The OSTTRA joint venture is accounted for using the equity method of accounting, and our share of earnings or losses are recognized in Equity in income on unconsolidated subsidiaries in our consolidated statements of income.

## Foreign currency translation

We have operations in many foreign countries. For most international operations, the local currency is the functional currency. For international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent company, the United States ('U.S.') dollar is the functional currency. For local currency operations, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using end of period exchange rates, and revenue and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates. Foreign currency translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate component of equity.

## Depreciation

The costs of property and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method based upon the following estimated useful lives: buildings and improvements from 15 to 40 years and equipment and furniture from 2 to 10 years. The costs of leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the useful lives or the terms of the respective leases.

## Advertising expense

The cost of advertising is expensed as incurred. We incurred $229 million, $209 million and $177 million in advertising costs for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

## Stock-based compensation

Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period, which typically is the vesting period. Stock-based compensation is classified as both operatingrelated expense and selling and general expense in the consolidated statements of income.

## Income taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in interest expense and operating expense, respectively.

Judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial performance of the operation that is recording a net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions, and we are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities. We believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events. It is possible that tax examinations will be settled prior to December 31, 2025. If any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period we would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits.

As of December 31, 2024, we have approximately $8.5 billion of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, of which $4.7 billion is reinvested indefinitely in our foreign operations.

## Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest

The agreement with the minority partners of our S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture contains redemption features whereby interests held by our minority partners are redeemable either (i) at the option of the holder or (ii) upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within our control. Since redemption of the noncontrolling interest is outside of our control, this interest is presented on our consolidated balance sheets under the caption 'Redeemable noncontrolling interest.' If the interest were to be redeemed, we would generally be required to purchase the interest at fair value on the date of redemption. We adjust the redeemable noncontrolling interest each reporting period to its estimated redemption value, but never less than its initial fair value, using both income and market valuation approaches. Our income and market valuation approaches incorporate Level 3 measures for instances when observable inputs are not available. The more significant judgmental assumptions used to estimate the value of the S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture include an estimated discount rate, a range of assumptions that form the basis of the expected future net cash flows (e.g., the revenue growth rates and operating margins), and a company specific beta. The significant judgmental

assumptions used that incorporate market data, including the relative weighting of market observable information and the comparability of that information in our valuation models, are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. Any adjustments to the redemption value will impact retained income. See Note 9 Equity for further detail.

## Contingencies

We accrue for loss contingencies when both (a) information available prior to issuance of the consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (b) the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on an analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Because many of these matters are resolved over long periods of time, our estimate of liabilities may change due to new developments, changes in assumptions or changes in our strategy related to the matter. When we accrue for loss contingencies and the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range, we record our best estimate within the range. We disclose an estimated possible loss or a range of loss when it is at least reasonably possible that a loss may be incurred.

## Recent Accounting Standards

In November of 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') issued accounting guidance which requires that an entity disclose, in the notes to financial statements, additional information about specific expense categories. The amendments in this update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the Company's disclosures.

In December of 2023, the FASB issued accounting guidance that expands disclosures in an entity's income tax rate reconciliation table and regarding cash taxes paid both in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted, and should be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the Company's disclosures.

In November of 2023, the FASB issued accounting guidance that expands reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this guidance and the amendments have been applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. As a result of the adoption of this guidance, we enhanced our disclosures about significant expenses regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included in the segment's measure of profit or loss to assess segment performance and allocate resources. See Note 12 Segment and Geographic Information for additional information.

## Reclassification

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for comparability purposes.

The acquisition of TruSight is not material to our consolidated financial statements.

None of our acquisitions completed during 2023 were material individually or in the aggregate, including the pro forma impact on earnings. For acquisitions during 2023 that were accounted for using the purchase method, the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is allocated to goodwill and other intangibles. The goodwill recognized on our acquisitions is largely attributable to anticipated operational synergies and growth opportunities as a result of the acquisition. The intangible assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, are being amortized over their anticipated useful lives of  5-7 years.

## 2022

On December 1, 2022, we completed the acquisition of the Shades of Green business from the Center for International Climate Research ('CICERO'), Norway's foremost institute for interdisciplinary climate research. The acquisition was integrated into S&amp;P Global Ratings and further expanded the breadth and depth of its second party opinions (SPOs) offering. SPOs are independent assessments of a company's financing or framework's alignment with market standards and typically provided before any borrowing is raised. The acquisition of the Shades of Green business is not material to our consolidated financial statements.

## Merger with IHS Markit

On February 28, 2022, we completed the merger with IHS Markit by acquiring 100% of the IHS Markit common stock that was issued and outstanding as of the date of acquisition, and as a result, IHS Markit and its subsidiaries became wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries of S&amp;P Global. Upon completion of the merger with IHS Markit, IHS Markit stockholders received 113.8 million shares of S&amp;P Global's common stock, at an exchange ratio of 0.2838 S&amp;P Global shares for each share of IHS Markit common stock, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. The Company also issued approximately 0.9 million replacement equity award shares for IHS Markit equity awards that were assumed pursuant to the merger agreement.

The fair value of the consideration transferred for IHS Markit was approximately $43.5 billion as of the merger date, which consisted of the following:

1. Objective: The table presents a summary of the equity consideration involved in the transfer of S&P Global common stock to IHS Markit stockholders as of February 28, 2022.

## Allocation of Purchase Price

A reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate for financial reporting purposes is as follows:

1.  Objective: The table presents a reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the effective income tax rate.
2.  Layout: The table is structured with rows representing various factors that contribute to the difference between the statutory and effective tax rates, such as state and local income taxes, foreign operations, stock-based compensation, joint venture activities, tax credits and incentives, divestitures, and other miscellaneous items. Columns display the impact of each factor on the effective tax rate for the years 2022, 2023, and 2024. The final row shows the calculated effective income tax rate for each year.
3.  Significance: This table provides a clear and concise breakdown of the elements influencing the company's effective tax rate, enabling stakeholders to understand the impact of different tax-related items on the company's financial performance over the three-year period. It facilitates analysis of tax planning strategies, identification of key drivers of tax rate fluctuations, and comparison of the company's tax burden across different periods.

Fluctuation in tax rates by year is primarily due to tax charge on merger related divestitures and change in mix of income by jurisdiction.

We have elected to recognize the tax on Global Intangible Low Taxed Income ('GILTI') as a period expense in the year the tax is incurred. GILTI expense is included in Other, net above.

The principal temporary differences between the accounting for income and expenses for financial reporting and income tax purposes are as follows:

1.  Objective: The table presents a comparative analysis of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the years 2024 and 2023.
2.  Layout: The table is structured with two columns representing the financial years 2024 and 2023, and rows detailing various components of deferred tax assets (e.g., accrued expenses, losses carryforwards, R&D expenditures) and deferred tax liabilities (e.g., goodwill and intangible assets). It further calculates total deferred tax assets and liabilities, net deferred income tax asset before valuation allowance, valuation allowance, and net deferred income tax liability. Finally, it reports non-current deferred tax assets and liabilities, culminating in the net deferred income tax liability.
3.  Significance: This table provides a clear overview of the company's deferred tax position, enabling stakeholders to assess the potential future tax consequences of temporary differences between financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. It facilitates analysis of changes in deferred tax balances over time and informs decisions related to tax planning and financial reporting.

We record valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets when we determine that it is more likely than not that such deferred income tax assets will not be realized based upon all the available evidence. The valuation allowance is primarily related to operating losses and other carryforwards.

As of December 31, 2024, we have approximately $8.5 billion of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, of which $4.7 billion is reinvested indefinitely in our foreign operations. We have not recorded deferred income taxes applicable to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Quantification of the deferred tax liability, if any, associated with indefinitely reinvested earnings is not practicable.

We made net income tax payments totaling $1,159 million in 2024, $1,279 million in 2023, and $1,555 million in 2022. As of December 31, 2024, we had net operating loss carryforwards of $1,228 million, of which a significant portion has an unlimited carryover period under current law.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

1. Objective: The table presents a reconciliation of the balance of uncertain tax positions, detailing the changes from the beginning to the end of the year.
2. Layout: The table is structured with rows representing the components of the balance reconciliation, including the beginning balance, additions based on current and prior year tax positions, reductions for settlements, expirations of statutes of limitations, and the resulting end-of-year balance. Columns provide the financial data for each component across three consecutive years, allowing for year-over-year comparison. All values are presented in millions of dollars.
3. Significance: This table provides a clear and concise view of the factors influencing the company's uncertain tax positions. It facilitates analysis of trends in tax-related additions and reductions, enabling stakeholders to understand the drivers of changes in the balance and assess the potential financial impact of uncertain tax positions over time. The data supports informed decision-making related to tax planning, risk management, and financial reporting.

The total amount of federal, state and local, and foreign unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $325 million, $230 million and $223 million, respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the change in unrecognized tax benefits resulted in a net increase of tax expense of $95 million.

We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operatingrelated expense, respectively. Based on the current status of income tax audits, we believe that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits on the balance sheet may be reduced by up to approximately $16 million in the next twelve months as a result of the resolution of local tax examinations and expiration of applicable statutes of limitations. In addition to the unrecognized tax benefits, we had accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits of $65 million and $50 million as of  December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The U.S. federal income tax audits for 2018 through 2024 are in process. During 2024, we completed state and foreign tax audits and, with few exceptions, we are no longer subject to federal, state, or foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years before 2016. The impact to tax expense in 2024, 2023 and 2022 was not material.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions, and we are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities. We believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events. It is possible that tax examinations will be settled prior to December 31, 2025. If any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period, we would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits.

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') introduced an international tax framework under Pillar Two which includes a global minimum tax of 15%. This framework has been implemented by several jurisdictions, including jurisdictions in which we operate, with effect from January 1, 2024, and many other jurisdictions, including jurisdictions in which we operate, are in the process of implementing it. The effect of enacted Pillar Two taxes has been included in the results disclosed and did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. The Company continues to monitor jurisdictions that are expected to implement Pillar Two in the future, and it is in the process of evaluating the potential impact of the enactment of Pillar Two by such jurisdictions on its consolidated financial statements.

## 5.   Debt

A summary of short-term and long-term debt outstanding is as follows:

1.  Objective: Summary of outstanding debt obligations, categorized by type and maturity date, for comparative analysis between two fiscal years.
2.  Layout: The table presents a columnar structure with the first column listing specific debt instruments, including senior notes with varying interest rates and maturity dates, and commercial paper. Subsequent columns provide the outstanding debt amounts in millions of dollars for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023. The table also includes subtotals for total debt, short-term debt, and long-term debt, facilitating a clear understanding of the company's debt structure and its evolution over the year.
3.  Significance: This table serves as a crucial reference for assessing the company's financial health and risk profile. It enables stakeholders to analyze debt maturity schedules, track changes in debt levels, and evaluate the impact of debt on the company's overall financial position. The comparative data allows for trend analysis and informed decision-making regarding debt management strategies.

Annual long-term debt maturities are scheduled as follows based on book values as of December 31, 2024: $4 million due in 2025, $3 million due in 2026, $1.7 billion due in 2027; $797 million due in 2028; $2.7 billion due in 2029; and $6.1 billion due thereafter.

The fair value of our total debt borrowings was $10.0 billion and $10.3 billion as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and was estimated based on quoted market prices.

On September 12, 2023, we issued $750 million of 5.25% senior notes due in 2033. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Standard &amp; Poor's Financial Services LLC. In the third quarter of 2023, the Company used the net proceeds to repay its outstanding commercial paper borrowings.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized an $8 million loss on extinguishment of debt. The year ended December 31, 2022 includes a $142 million tender premium paid to tendering note holders in accordance with the terms of the tender offer, partially offset by a $134 million non-cash write-off related to the fair market value step up premium on extinguished debt.

On December 17, 2024, we entered into a revolving $2.0 billion five-year credit agreement that will terminate on December 17, 2029 (our 'credit facility'). This credit facility replaced our revolving $2.0 billion five-year credit facility that was scheduled to terminate on April 26, 2026 (our 'previous credit facility'). The previous credit facility was canceled immediately after the new credit facility became effective. There were no outstanding borrowings under the previous credit facility when it was replaced.

We have the ability to borrow a total of $2.0 billion through our commercial paper program, which is supported by our credit facility. As of December 31, 2024  and 2023, we had no outstanding commercial paper.

Commitment fees for the unutilized commitments under the credit facility and applicable margins for borrowings thereunder are linked to the Company achieving three environmental sustainability performance indicators related to emissions, tested annually. We currently pay a commitment fee of 7 basis points. The credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and customary events of default. The occurrence of an event of default could result in an acceleration of the obligations under the credit facility.

The only financial covenant required under our credit facility is that our indebtedness to cash flow ratio, as defined in our credit facility, was not greater than 4 to 1, and this covenant level has never been exceeded.

## 6.   Derivative Instruments

Our exposure to market risk includes changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. We have operations in foreign countries where the functional currency is primarily the local currency. For international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent company, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. We typically have naturally hedged positions in most countries from a local currency perspective with offsetting assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate or hedge the effect of adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held cross currency swap contracts to hedge a portion of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries against volatility in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2023, we held a series of interest rate swaps to mitigate or hedge the adverse fluctuations in interest rates on our future debt refinancing. These contracts are recorded at fair value that is based on foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates in active markets; therefore, we classify these derivative contracts within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

## Undesignated Derivative Instruments

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts in order to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. These forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the aggregate notional value of these outstanding forward contracts was $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. The changes in fair value of these forward contracts are recorded in prepaid and other assets or other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in selling and general expenses in the consolidated statements of income. The amount recorded in prepaid and other current assets was $69 million as of December 31, 2023. The amount recorded in other current liabilities was $42 million and $1 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The amount recorded in selling and general expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 related to these contracts was a net gain $60 million, a net gain of $81 million and a net loss of $45 million, respectively.

## Net Investment Hedges

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 we entered into cross currency swaps to hedge a portion of our net investment in certain European subsidiaries against volatility in the Euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we held cross currency swaps to hedge a portion of our net investment in one of our European subsidiaries against volatility in the Euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate. These swaps are designated and qualify as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign subsidiary and are scheduled to mature in 2029, 2030, 2032 and 2033. The notional value of our outstanding cross currency swaps designated as a net investment hedge was $3.5 billion and $1.5 billion as December 31, 2024 and 2023. The changes in the fair value of these swaps are recognized in foreign currency translation adjustments, a component of other comprehensive income (loss), and reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet. The gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold, liquidated or substantially liquidated. We have elected to assess the effectiveness of our net investment hedges based on changes in spot exchange rates. Accordingly, amounts related to the cross currency swaps recognized directly in net income represent net periodic interest settlements and accruals, which are recognized in interest expense, net. We recognized net interest income of $41 million, net interest income of $25 million and net interest expense of $31 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

## Cash Flow Hedges

## Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of the Indian rupee, British pound, and Euro exposures through the fourth quarter of 2026, 2025 and 2024, respectively. These contracts are intended to offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future revenue and operating costs and are scheduled to mature within twentyfour months. The changes in the fair value of these contracts are initially reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet and are subsequently reclassified into revenue and selling and general expenses in the same period that the hedged transaction affects earnings.

As of December 31, 2024, we estimate that $1 million of pre-tax gain related to foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges recorded in other comprehensive income is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the aggregate notional value of our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges was $539 million and $529 million, respectively.

## Interest Rate Swaps

In the first quarter of 2024, we terminated our interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional value of $813 million and received net proceeds of $155 million upon termination. These contracts were designated as cash flow hedges and were scheduled to mature beginning in the first quarter of 2027. We performed a final effectiveness test upon the termination of each swap, and the effective portion of the gain of $155 million was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet. The gain will be recognized into interest expense, net over the term which related interest payments will be made when we enter into anticipated future debt refinancing.

The following table provides information on the location and fair value amounts of our cash flow hedges and net investment hedges as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

1.  Objective: Presentation of derivative financial instruments categorized by balance sheet location and hedge designation.
2.  Layout: The table is structured with rows representing specific balance sheet line items (assets and liabilities, both current and non-current) where derivative instruments are recorded. These line items are further categorized by whether the derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges or net investment hedges. Columns provide a description of the specific derivative contract type (e.g., foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swap contracts, cross currency swaps) and the corresponding financial values in millions of dollars for the reporting period (2024) and the prior year (2023).
3.  Significance: This table provides a clear overview of the company's derivative positions, enabling stakeholders to understand the nature and magnitude of the company's hedging activities and their impact on the balance sheet. It facilitates analysis of changes in derivative values over time and provides insights into the company's risk management strategies related to foreign exchange and interest rate exposures.

The following table provides information on the location and amounts of pre-tax gains (losses) on our cash flow hedges and net investment hedges for the years ended December 31:

1.  Objective: The table presents a reconciliation of gains and losses related to cash flow and net investment hedges, specifically detailing amounts recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL) and subsequently reclassified into income.
2.  Layout: The table is organized with rows representing different hedging instruments, including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swap contracts, and cross-currency swaps. Columns are grouped into three sections: "Gain (Loss) recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (effective portion)", "Location of Gain (Loss) reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss into Income (effective portion)", and "Gain (Loss) reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss into Income (effective portion)". Each section provides financial data for the years 2024, 2023, and 2022, expressed in millions of dollars. The "Location of Gain (Loss)" column provides a textual description of where the reclassified gains or losses are recorded within the income statement.
3.  Significance: This table is crucial for understanding the impact of hedging activities on the company's financial statements. It allows stakeholders to track the movement of gains and losses through AOCL and into income, providing transparency into the effectiveness of hedging strategies and their ultimate effect on profitability. The data facilitates analysis of trends in hedging performance over the three-year period and informs decisions related to risk management and financial reporting.

The activity related to the change in unrealized gains (losses) in accumulated other comprehensive loss was as follows for the years ended December 31:

1.  Objective: The table presents a reconciliation of net unrealized gains or losses on various hedging instruments, including cash flow hedges and net investment hedges, over a three-year period.
2.  Layout: The table is structured with rows delineating specific hedging instruments (foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swap contracts, and net investment hedges) and their components. For each instrument, the table details the beginning net unrealized gain/loss, the change in fair value, the reclassification into earnings, and the resulting end-of-period net unrealized gain/loss. Columns provide the corresponding financial data for the years 2024, 2023, and 2022, allowing for a year-over-year comparison.
3.  Significance: This table is crucial for understanding the impact of hedging activities on the company's financial position. It facilitates analysis of the effectiveness of different hedging strategies, tracks the movement of gains and losses through fair value changes and reclassifications, and provides a clear view of the net impact of these activities on the balance sheet over time. This information is essential for investors, analysts, and management in assessing risk management practices and financial performance.

## 7.   Employee Benefits

We maintain a number of active defined contribution retirement plans for our employees. The majority of our defined benefit plans are frozen. As a result, no new employees will be permitted to enter these plans and no additional benefits for current participants in the frozen plans will be accrued.

We also have supplemental benefit plans that provide senior management with supplemental retirement, disability and death benefits. Certain supplemental retirement benefits are based on final monthly earnings. In addition, we sponsor a voluntary 401(k) plan under which we may match employee contributions up to certain levels of compensation as well as profit-sharing plans under which we contribute a percentage of eligible employees' compensation to the employees' accounts.

We also provide certain medical, dental and life insurance benefits for active employees and eligible dependents. The medical and dental plans and supplemental life insurance plan are contributory, while the basic life insurance plan is noncontributory. We currently do not prefund any of these plans.

We recognize the funded status of our retirement and postretirement plans in the consolidated balance sheets, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes. The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss represent net unrecognized actuarial losses and unrecognized prior service costs. These amounts will be subsequently recognized as net periodic pension cost pursuant to our accounting policy for amortizing such amounts.

Net periodic benefit cost for our retirement and postretirement plans other than the service cost component are included in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income.

## Benefit Obligation

A summary of the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets, as well as the funded status for the retirement and postretirement plans as of December 31, 2024 and

2023, is as follows (benefits paid in the table below include only those amounts contributed directly to or paid directly from plan assets):

1.  Objective: The table presents a reconciliation of benefit obligations and plan assets for both retirement and postretirement plans, providing a detailed view of the components contributing to the funded status and amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets.
2.  Layout: The table is structured with rows detailing various components affecting the net benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets, such as service cost, interest cost, actuarial gains/losses, employer contributions, and gross benefits paid. These components are used to calculate the net benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets at the end of the year, leading to the determination of the funded status. Subsequent sections outline amounts recognized in consolidated balance sheets, accumulated benefit obligation, and amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax. The table is organized into four columns, presenting data for retirement and postretirement plans for the years 2024 and 2023, allowing for year-over-year comparison.
3.  Significance: This table is crucial for understanding the financial health and obligations associated with employee benefit plans. It facilitates analysis of the factors influencing the funded status of these plans, provides insights into the amounts recognized on the balance sheet, and supports informed decision-making related to plan funding and management. The comparative data enables trend analysis and assessment of the impact of various factors on the overall financial position of the benefit plans.

1 Effective January 1, 2024, we changed our discount rate assumption on our U.S. retirement plans to 5.27% from 5.63% in 2023 and changed our discount rate assumption on our U.K. plan to 4.50% from 4.76% in 2023.

2 The expected return on assets assumption is calculated based on the plan's asset allocation strategy and projected market returns over the long-term. Effective January 1, 2025, we changed our return on assets assumption to 6.25% from 6.00% for the U.S. plan in 2024 and to 5.40% from 5.50% for the U.K. plan in 2024.

## Cash Flows

Expected employer contributions in 2025 are $11 million and $2 million for our retirement and postretirement plans, respectively. In 2025, we may elect to make non-required contributions depending on investment performance and the pension plan status.

Information about the expected cash flows for our retirement and postretirement plans is as follows:

1.  Objective: The table presents projected financial data for retirement and post-retirement plans over a specified period.
2.  Layout: The table is structured with rows representing specific years or a range of years (2025-2034). The columns display the financial projections, in millions, for "Retirement Plans" and "Postretirement Plans" respectively. The "Retirement Plans" column shows the projected value of retirement plans for each year, while the "Postretirement Plans" column shows the projected value of postretirement plans for each year.
3.  Significance: This table provides a concise overview of the anticipated financial performance of retirement and post-retirement plans. It serves as a valuable tool for financial planning, forecasting, and strategic decision-making related to these plans, allowing stakeholders to assess growth trends and potential future financial positions.

## Fair Value of Plan Assets

In accordance with authoritative guidance for fair value measurements certain assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value. Fair value is defined as the amount that would be received for selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. A fair value hierarchy has been established which requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:

- -Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- -Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
- -Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

The fair value of our defined benefit plans assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, by asset class is as follows:

1.  Objective: The table presents a breakdown of investment assets by type and fair value hierarchy level as of December 31, 2024.
2.  Layout: The table is structured with rows representing different asset categories, including cash and short-term investments, fixed income (specifically a long duration strategy), and collective investment funds. Columns display the total value of each asset category, followed by a breakdown of these values across Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Totals are provided for the initial asset categories and for the overall investment portfolio.
3.  Significance: This table provides a clear view of the company's investment portfolio composition and the liquidity of those investments. It is useful for assessing the risk profile of the investment portfolio, understanding the valuation methodologies applied to different asset types, and for regulatory reporting purposes related to fair value measurements.

1 Includes securities that are mainly investment grade obligations of issuers in the U.S.

2 Includes the Standard &amp; Poor's MidCap 600 Composite Stock Index, Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Composite Stock Index, the Standard &amp; Poor's MidCap 400 Composite Stock Index, a short-term investment fund which is a common collective trust vehicle, and other various asset classes.

3 Includes a fund which holds real estate properties in the U.K.

For securities that are quoted in active markets, the trustee/ custodian determines fair value by applying securities' prices obtained from its pricing vendors. For commingled funds that are not actively traded, the trustee applies pricing information provided by investment management firms to the unit quantities of such funds. Investment management firms employ their own pricing vendors to value the securities underlying each commingled fund. Underlying securities that are not actively traded derive their prices from investment managers, which in turn, employ vendors that use pricing models (e.g., discounted cash flow, comparables). The domestic defined benefit plans have no investment in our stock, except through the S&amp;P 500 commingled trust index fund.

The trustee obtains estimated prices from vendors for securities that are not easily quotable and they are categorized accordingly as Level 3. The following table details further information on our plan assets where we have used significant unobservable inputs:

1. Objective: The table presents a reconciliation of financial balances for a specific level, detailing the changes from the beginning to the end of a reporting period.
2. Layout: The table is structured with two columns. The first column lists the components of the reconciliation, including the beginning balance as of December 31, 2023, distributions, and the ending balance as of December 31, 2024. The second column, labeled "Level 3," provides the corresponding financial values in millions of dollars for each component. The table format allows for a clear and concise presentation of the changes in the balance over the period.
3. Significance: This table provides a clear audit trail of the financial activity for Level 3, enabling stakeholders to understand the factors contributing to the change in balance. It is useful for financial analysis, reporting, and decision-making related to the specific level's financial performance. The table's structure facilitates easy comparison and identification of key drivers impacting the balance.

## Pension Trusts' Asset Allocations

There are two pension trusts, one in the U.S. and one in the U.K.

- -The U.S. pension trust had assets of $1,130 million and $1,176 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively, and the target allocations in 2024 include 90% fixed income, 5% domestic equities, 3% international equities and 2% cash and cash equivalents.
- -The U.K. pension trust had assets of $265 million and $297 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and the target allocations in 2024 include 95% fixed income and 5% diversified growth funds.

The pension assets are invested with the goal of producing a combination of capital growth, income and a liability hedge. The mix of assets is established after consideration of the longterm performance and risk characteristics of asset classes. Investments are selected based on their potential to enhance returns, preserve capital and reduce overall volatility. Holdings are diversified within each asset class. The portfolios employ a mix of index and actively managed equity strategies by market capitalization, style, geographic regions and economic sectors. The fixed income strategies include U.S. long duration securities, core fixed income, intermediate credit, high yield, and U.K. debt instruments. The short-term portfolio, whose primary goal is capital preservation for liquidity purposes, is composed of government and government-agency securities, uninvested cash, receivables and payables. The portfolios do not employ any financial leverage.

## U.S. Defined Contribution Plan

Assets of the defined contribution plan in the U.S. consist primarily of investment options, which include actively managed equity, indexed equity, actively managed equity/bond funds, target date funds, S&amp;P Global Inc. common stock, stable value and money market strategies. There is also a self-directed mutual fund investment option. The plan purchased 81,400 shares and sold 159,810 shares of S&amp;P Global Inc. common stock in 2024 and purchased 146,600 shares and sold 179,569 shares of S&amp;P Global Inc. common stock in 2023. The plan held approximately 1.1 million and 1.2 million shares of S&amp;P Global Inc. common stock as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with market values of $547 million and $518 million, respectively. The plan received dividends on S&amp;P Global Inc. common stock of $4.4 million and $4.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

## 8. Stock-Based Compensation

We issue stock-based incentive awards to our eligible employees under the 2019 Employee Stock Incentive Plan and to our eligible non-employee members of the Board of Directors under a Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan. No further awards may be granted under the 2002 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the '2002 Plan'), although awards granted under the 2002 Plan prior to the adoption of the new 2019 Plan in June of 2019 remain outstanding in accordance with their terms.

- -2019 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the '2019 Plan') -The 2019 Plan permits the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, performance awards, and other stock-based awards.
- -Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan (the 'Director Plan') - Under the Director Plan, common stock reserved may be credited to deferred stock accounts for eligible nonemployee members of the Board of Directors. In general, the plan requires that 50% of eligible Directors' annual compensation and dividend equivalents be credited to deferred stock accounts. Each Director may also elect to defer all or a portion of the remaining compensation and have an equivalent number of shares credited to their deferred stock account. Recipients under this plan are not required to provide consideration to us other than rendering service. Shares will be delivered as of the date a recipient ceases to be a member of the Board of Directors or within five years thereafter, if so elected. The plan will remain in effect until terminated by the Board of Directors or until no shares of stock remain available under the plan.
- -2014 Equity Incentive Award Plan and the Amended and Restated IHS Inc. 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 'IHS Markit's equity plans') - In connection with the merger with IHS Markit, we assumed the outstanding restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units, deferred stock units, and stock options granted under IHS Markit's equity plans, converted using the 0.2838 merger exchange ratio. From the merger date, no additional awards under these plans may be granted; however, the outstanding awards that were converted at the merger date continue to vest in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.

The number of common shares reserved for issuance under the 2019 Plan are as follows:

1. Objective: The table presents a summary of shares available for granting, options outstanding, and total shares reserved for issuance, expressed in millions.
2. Layout: The table is structured with three rows representing different share-related metrics: "Shares available for granting," "Options outstanding," and "Total shares reserved for issuance." The columns provide comparative data for two consecutive years, 2024 and 2023, allowing for a year-over-year comparison of these metrics.
3. Significance: This table provides a concise overview of the company's share allocation and availability, which is crucial for understanding its equity compensation strategy and potential dilution. It facilitates analysis of changes in share reserves and outstanding options, informing decisions related to employee compensation, investor relations, and overall financial planning.

| Total shares reserved for issuance | 18.0           |           18.4 |

1 Shares reserved for issuance under the Director Plan are less than 1.0 million at both December 31, 2024 and 2023.

We issue treasury shares upon the issuance of restricted stock and other stock-based awards and the exercise of stock options. To offset the dilutive effect of our equity compensation plans, we periodically repurchase shares. See Note 9 Equity for further discussion.

Stock-based compensation expense and the corresponding tax benefit are as follows:

1. Objective: The table presents a summary of stock-based compensation expenses and related tax benefits for the years 2022 through 2024.

## Restricted Stock and Other Stock-Based Awards

Restricted stock and other stock-based awards (performance and non-performance) have been granted under the 2002 Plan and 2019 Plan. Performance unit awards only vest if we achieve certain financial goals over the performance period. Restricted stock non-performance awards have various vesting periods (generally three years). Recipients of restricted stock and unit awards are not required to provide consideration to us other than rendering service.

The stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock and other stock-based awards is determined based on the market price of our stock at the grant date of the award applied to the total number of awards that are anticipated to fully vest. For performance awards, adjustments are made to expense consistent with the expected percent achievement of the performance goals.

Restricted stock and other stock-based award activity is as follows:

1.  Objective: The table presents a summary of share-based compensation activity, detailing changes in outstanding shares and their associated fair value over a one-year period.

2.  Layout: The table is structured with rows representing key events affecting share balances (beginning balance, grants, vesting, forfeitures, and ending balance) and additional rows for total unrecognized compensation expense and the weighted-average years over which it will be recognized. Columns display the number of shares (in millions) and the weighted-average grant-date fair value per share.

## Stock Repurchases

On June 22, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of 30 million shares (the '2022 Repurchase Program'), which was approximately 9% of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time. On January 29, 2020, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of 30 million shares (the '2020 Repurchase Program'), which was approximately 12% of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time.

Our purchased shares may be used for general corporate purposes, including the issuance of shares for stock compensation plans and to offset the dilutive effect of the exercise of employee stock options. As of December 31, 2024, 12.0 million shares remained available under the 2022 Repurchase Program and the 2020 repurchase program was completed. Our 2022 Repurchase Program has no expiration date and purchases under this program may be made from time to time on the open market and in private transactions, depending on market conditions.

We have entered into accelerated share repurchase ('ASR') agreements with financial institutions to initiate share repurchases of our common stock. Under an ASR agreement, we pay a specified amount to the financial institution and receive an initial delivery of shares. This initial delivery of shares represents the minimum number of shares that we may receive under the agreement. Upon settlement of the ASR agreement, the financial institution typically delivers additional shares. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average price paid per share, is determined at the end of the applicable purchase period of each ASR agreement based on the volume weighted-average share price, less a discount. We account for our ASR agreements as two transactions: a stock purchase transaction and a forward stock purchase contract. The shares delivered under the ASR agreements resulted in a reduction of outstanding shares used to determine our weighted average common shares outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per share. The repurchased shares are held in Treasury. The forward stock purchase contracts are classified as equity instruments.

The terms of each ASR agreement entered into for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, structured as outlined above, are as follows:

- 11 The ASR agreement was structured as an uncapped ASR agreement in which we paid $7 billion and initially received shares valued at 85% of the $7 billion at a share equal to the then market price of the Company's common stock on March 1, 2022 when the company received an initial delivery of 15.2 million shares from the ASR program. We completed the ASR agreement on August 9, 2022 and received an additional 4.1 million shares. The ASR agreement was executed under our 2020 Repurchase Program.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, we received a total of 6.7 million shares, including 0.2 million shares received in February of 2024 related to our November 13, 2023 ASR agreement, resulting in $3.3 billion of cash used to purchase shares. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we received a total of 8.6 million shares, including 0.4 million shares received in February of 2023 related to our December 2, 2022 ASR agreement, resulting in $3.3 billion of cash used to purchase shares. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we purchased 33.5 million shares for $12.0 billion of cash.

## Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests

Our redeemable interests include an agreement with the minority partners that own 27% of our S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture contains redemption features whereby interests held by minority partners are redeemable either (i) at the option of the holder or (ii) upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within our control. Specifically, under the terms of the operating agreement of S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC, CME Group and CME Group Index Services LLC ('CGIS') has the right at any time to sell, and we are obligated to buy, at least 20% of their share in S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC. In addition, in the event there is a change of control of the Company, for the 15 days following a change in control, CME Group and CGIS will have the right to put their interest to us at the then fair value of CME Group's and CGIS' minority interest.

If interests were to be redeemed under this agreement, we would generally be required to purchase the interest at fair value on the date of redemption. This interest is presented on the consolidated balance sheets outside of equity under the caption 'Redeemable noncontrolling interests' with an initial value based on fair value for the portion attributable to the net assets we acquired, and based on our historical cost for the portion attributable to our S&amp;P Index business. We adjust the redeemable noncontrolling interest each reporting period to its estimated redemption value, but never less than its initial fair value, using both income and market valuation approaches. Our income and market valuation approaches may incorporate Level 3 fair value measures for instances when observable inputs are not available. The more significant judgmental assumptions used to estimate the value of the S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture include an estimated discount rate, a range of assumptions that form the basis of the expected future net cash flows (e.g., the revenue growth rates and operating margins), and a company specific beta. The significant judgmental assumptions used that incorporate market data, including the relative weighting of market observable information and the comparability of that information in our valuation models, are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. Any adjustments to the redemption value will impact retained income.

Noncontrolling interests that do not contain such redemption features are presented in equity.

Changes to redeemable noncontrolling interests during the year ended December 31, 2024 were as follows:

1. Objective: The table presents a reconciliation of the balance of redeemable noncontrolling interests from December 31, 2023, to December 31, 2024.
2. Layout: The table is structured with two columns. The first column lists the components contributing to the change in the balance, including the beginning balance, net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests, distributions to noncontrolling interests, redemption value adjustment, and other adjustments. The second column displays the corresponding financial values in millions of dollars for each component, culminating in the ending balance as of December 31, 2024.
3. Significance: This table provides a clear and concise summary of the factors influencing the change in redeemable noncontrolling interests over the specified period. It is useful for financial analysis, allowing stakeholders to understand the drivers behind the increase or decrease in this balance and to assess the financial impact of noncontrolling interests on the overall financial position.

## 10. Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per common share ('EPS') is computed by dividing net income attributable to the common shareholders of the Company by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed in the same manner as basic EPS, except the number of shares is increased

The calculation for basic and diluted EPS is as follows:

1.  Objective: The table presents a financial overview of S&P Global Inc., specifically focusing on the amount attributable to common shareholders and earnings per share (EPS) over a three-year period.
2.  Layout: The table is organized into two primary sections: "Amount attributable to S&P Global Inc. common shareholders" and "Earnings per share attributable to S&P Global Inc. common shareholders." Each section includes rows detailing specific financial metrics, such as net income, basic weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, effect of dilutive securities, diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, basic EPS, and diluted EPS. The columns represent the financial years 2024, 2023, and 2022, allowing for year-over-year comparison of these metrics.
3.  Significance: This table provides a concise summary of S&P Global Inc.'s financial performance from the perspective of common shareholders. It facilitates the analysis of net income trends, the impact of share dilution, and the resulting EPS, enabling investors and stakeholders to assess the company's profitability and shareholder value creation over time. The data is useful for comparative financial analysis, investment decision-making, and understanding the company's financial health.

We have certain stock options and restricted performance shares that are potentially excluded from the computation of diluted EPS. The effect of the potential exercise of stock options is excluded when the average market price of our common stock is lower than the exercise price of the related option during the period or when a net loss exists because the effect would have been antidilutive. Additionally, restricted performance shares are excluded because the necessary vesting conditions had not been met or when a net loss exists. Restricted performance shares outstanding of 0.5 million as of December 31, 2024, 0.7 million as of December 31, 2023 and 0.6 million as of December 31, 2022, respectively, were excluded. As of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, there were no stock options excluded.

to include additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potential common shares with a dilutive effect had been issued. Potential common shares consist primarily of restricted performance shares and stock options calculated using the treasury stock method.

## 11. Restructuring

We continuously evaluate our cost structure to identify cost savings associated with streamlining our management structure. Our 2024 and 2023 restructuring plans consisted of companywide workforce reductions of approximately 1,230 and 1,050 positions, respectively, and are further detailed below. The charges for each restructuring plan are classified as selling and general expenses within the consolidated statements of income and the reserves are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

In certain circumstances, reserves are no longer needed because employees previously identified for separation resigned from the Company and did not receive severance or were reassigned due to circumstances not foreseen when the original plans were initiated. In these cases, we reverse reserves through the consolidated statements of income during the period when it is determined they are no longer needed.

The initial restructuring charge recorded and the ending reserve balance as of December 31, 2024 by segment is as follows:

1. Objective: The table presents a comparative overview of restructuring plans for 2024 and 2023, detailing financial charges and reserve balances across various business segments.
2. Layout: The table is organized into rows representing different business segments (e.g., Market Intelligence, Ratings) and columns providing financial data. Specifically, for each year (2024 and 2023), the table shows the "Initial Charge Recorded" and the "Ending Reserve Balance," both expressed in millions of dollars. A "Total" row summarizes the aggregate values for each financial metric in each year.
3. Significance: This table facilitates a direct comparison of restructuring efforts and their financial impact across different business segments between the two years. It allows for the identification of segments with the most significant changes in initial charges or reserve balances, aiding in resource allocation decisions and performance evaluation of the restructuring initiatives.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of $125 million primarily related to employee severance charges for the 2024 restructuring plan and have reduced the reserve by $37 million. For the years ended

December 31, 2024 and 2023, we have reduced the reserve for the 2023 restructuring plan by $132 million and $31 million, respectively. The reductions primarily related to cash payments for employee severance charges.

## 12. Segment and Geographic Information

As discussed in Note 1 Accounting Policies , we have five reportable segments: Market Intelligence, Ratings, Commodity Insights, Mobility and Indices.

Our Chief Executive Officer is our chief operating decision-maker ('CODM') and evaluates performance of our segments and allocates resources (including employees, property, and financial or capital resources) based primarily on operating profit for each segment. Segment operating profit does not include Corporate Unallocated expense, equity in income on unconsolidated subsidiaries, other (income) expense, net, or interest expense, net, as these are amounts that do not affect the operating results of our reportable segments. We use the same accounting policies for our segments as those described in Note 1 Accounting Policies .

Operating results for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 is as follows:

1.  Objective: This table presents a financial overview, detailing revenue, expenses, and profit metrics for various business segments and the total company.
2.  Layout: The table is structured with rows representing different financial line items, such as revenue from external customers, segment expenses, operating profit, and income before taxes. Columns delineate these metrics across several business segments: Market Intelligence, Ratings, Commodity Insights, Mobility, Indices, and Engineering Solutions, with a final column providing the consolidated total. Intersegment revenue and elimination entries are also included to reconcile segment-level data with the overall financial performance.
3.  Significance: The table facilitates a comparative analysis of financial performance across different business segments, enabling stakeholders to identify key revenue drivers, cost centers, and profit contributors. It supports strategic decision-making by providing a clear view of segment-level profitability and the impact of intersegment transactions on the company's overall financial health.

1. Objective: The table presents a financial overview of revenue and expenses, broken down by business segment, to arrive at income before taxes on income for the year 2022.
2. Layout: The table is organized with business segments (Market Intelligence, Ratings, Commodity Insights, Mobility, Indices, and Engineering Solutions) as columns, and various revenue and expense line items as rows. These line items include revenue from external customers, intersegment revenue, segment expenses, other segment items, corporate unallocated expenses, and other income/expense items. A "Total" column aggregates the figures across all segments. The table progresses from gross revenue to segment operating profit, then incorporates corporate-level adjustments to ultimately calculate income before taxes on income.
3. Significance: This table provides a detailed view of the financial performance of each business segment and their contribution to the overall company's profitability. It allows for analysis of revenue sources, cost structures, and the impact of corporate-level expenses on the bottom line. The data facilitates strategic decision-making, performance evaluation, and resource allocation across different business units.

1 Intersegment revenue primarily relates to a royalty charged to Market Intelligence for the rights to use and distribute content and data developed by Ratings.

- 2 The segment expense category for Market Intelligence, Ratings, Commodity Insights, Mobility and Indices for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 primarily include an aggregation of compensation costs, technology costs and strategic investments. The segment expense category for Engineering Solutions for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 primarily include an aggregation of technology costs and compensation costs. The CODM considers actual-toactual and budget-to-actual variances when making decisions about allocating personnel and capital to the segments, however, the CODM does not receive the individual expense items underlying the overall segment expenses. Variance explanations include segment expenses including compensation costs, technology costs and strategic investments, but the CODM is otherwise not provided, and cannot easily calculate, lower-level expense information.

3 Other segment items for each reportable segment primarily include amortization of intangibles from acquisitions, (gain) loss on dispositions and certain items primarily including IHS Markit merger costs, employee severance charges and acquisition and disposition-related costs.

4 Corporate Unallocated expense includes costs for corporate functions, select initiatives, unoccupied office space and Kensho, included in selling and general expenses.

The following table presents our revenue disaggregated by revenue type for the years ended December 31:

1.  **Objective:** The table presents a revenue breakdown for 2024, segmented by various business lines and revenue types, providing a comprehensive view of financial performance across different sectors.

2.  **Layout:** The table is organized with rows representing different revenue streams, such as subscription, non-subscription/transaction, asset-linked fees, and sales usage-based royalties, as well as the timing of revenue recognition (services transferred at a point in time vs. over time). Columns delineate the revenue generated by each business segment, including Market Intelligence, Ratings, Commodity Insights, Mobility, Indices, and Engineering Solutions, with an additional column for intersegment eliminations and a final column for the total revenue across all segments. The table includes a "Total revenue" row for each section, providing a summary for each segment and the overall company.

3.  **Significance:** This table is valuable for understanding the relative contribution of each business segment to the overall revenue, identifying key revenue drivers, and analyzing the impact of intersegment transactions. It facilitates strategic decision-making by providing a clear picture of revenue distribution and performance across different business areas, enabling targeted resource allocation and performance evaluation.

## 13. Commitments and Contingencies

## Leases

We determine whether an arrangement meets the criteria for an operating lease or a finance lease at the inception of the arrangement.  We have operating leases for office space and equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 11 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to 12 years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases early. We sublease certain real estate leases to third parties which mainly consist of operating leases for space within our offices.

Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expenses for these leases on a straight line-basis over the lease term in operatingrelated expenses and selling and general expenses.

Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Our future minimum based payments used to determine our lease liabilities include minimum based rent payments and escalations. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.

During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $3 million, $26 million and $132 million, respectively, related to the impairment and abandonment of operating lease related ROU assets. The pre-tax impairment charge recorded during the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily associated with reductions in the anticipated sublease income on vacated leased facilities following the deterioration of local market conditions and consolidating our real estate facilities following the merger with IHS Markit. The impairment charges are included in selling and general expenses within the consolidated statements of income.

The following table provides information on the location and amounts of our leases on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:

1. Objective: The table presents a comparative summary of specific asset and liability accounts related to lease activities as reflected on the balance sheet.

## Related Party Agreement

In June of 2012, we entered into a license agreement (the 'License Agreement') with the holder of S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC noncontrolling interest, CME Group, which replaced the 2005 license agreement between Indices and CME Group. Under the terms of the License Agreement, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC receives a share of the profits from the trading and clearing of CME Group's equity index products. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC earned $192 million, $174 million and $170 million of revenue under the terms of the License Agreement, respectively. The entire amount of this revenue is included in our consolidated statement of income and the portion related to the 27% noncontrolling interest is removed in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.

## Contractual Obligations

We typically have various contractual obligations, which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, while other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts, are not recognized. For example, we are contractually committed to contracts for information-technology outsourcing, certain enterprise-wide information-technology software licensing and maintenance. In the first quarter of 2023, S&amp;P Global and Amazon Web Services ('AWS') entered into a multi-year strategic collaboration agreement with a purchase obligation of $1.0 billion, before incremental credits, over a fiveyear period. With AWS as its preferred cloud provider, S&amp;P Global will enhance its cloud infrastructure, accelerate business growth, engineer new innovations for key industry segments, and help their customers navigate rapidly changing market conditions.

## Legal &amp; Regulatory Matters

In the normal course of business both in the United States and abroad, the Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in a number of legal proceedings and are often subjected to government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries.

A class action lawsuit was filed in Australia on August 7, 2020 against the Company and a subsidiary of the Company. A separate lawsuit was filed against the Company and a subsidiary of the Company in Australia on February 2, 2021 by two entities within the Basis Capital investment group. The lawsuits both relate to alleged investment losses in collateralized debt obligations rated by Ratings prior to the financial crisis.  We can provide no assurance that we will not be obligated to pay significant amounts in order to resolve these matters on terms deemed acceptable.

From time to time, the Company receives customer complaints. The Company believes it has strong contractual protections in the terms and conditions included in its arrangements with customers.  Nonetheless, in the interest of managing customer relationships, the Company from time to time engages in dialogue with such customers in an effort to resolve such complaints, and if such complaints cannot be resolved through dialogue, may face litigation regarding such complaints.  The Company does not expect to incur material losses as a result of these matters.

Moreover, various government and self-regulatory agencies frequently make inquiries and conduct investigations into our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including those related to our regulated products and services, antitrust matters and other matters, such as ESG. For example, as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization ('NRSRO') registered with the SEC under Section 15E of the Exchange Act, S&amp;P Global Ratings is in ongoing communication with the staff of the SEC regarding compliance with its extensive obligations under the federal securities laws. On September 3, 2024, as part of an industry-wide investigation into off-channel communications by the SEC, S&amp;P Global Ratings, and certain other NRSROs, reached a settlement to resolve violations of recordkeeping rules. This matter was previously disclosed by S&amp;P Global. In the SEC's order, the SEC recognized S&amp;P Global Ratings' remedial acts and its cooperation with the SEC staff. As part of the resolution, S&amp;P Global Ratings paid a penalty of $20 million. S&amp;P Global previously accrued that amount in its consolidated financial statements for the second quarter of 2024. Although S&amp;P Global seeks to promptly address any compliance issues that it detects or that the staff of the SEC or another regulator raises, there can be no assurance that the SEC or another regulator will not seek remedies against S&amp;P Global for one or more compliance deficiencies. Any of these proceedings, investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties or activity restrictions, which could adversely impact our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position.

In view of the uncertainty inherent in litigation and government and regulatory enforcement matters, we cannot predict the eventual outcome of such matters or the timing of their resolution, or in most cases reasonably estimate what the eventual judgments, damages, fines, penalties or impact of activity (if any) restrictions may be. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that such outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position. As litigation or the process to resolve pending matters progresses, as the case may be, we will continue to review the latest information available and assess our ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position, which may require that we record liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.

## Report of Management

## To the Shareholders of S&amp;P Global Inc.

## Management's Annual Report on its Responsibility for the Company's Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The financial statements in this report were prepared by the management of S&amp;P Global Inc., which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity.

These statements, prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and including amounts based on management's best estimates and judgments, present fairly S&amp;P Global Inc.'s financial condition and the results of the Company's operations. Other financial information given in this report is consistent with these statements.

The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company as defined under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934. It further assures the quality of the financial records in several ways: a program of internal audits, the careful selection and training of management personnel, maintaining an organizational structure that provides an appropriate division of financial responsibilities, and communicating financial and other relevant policies throughout the Company.

S&amp;P Global Inc.'s Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, composed entirely of outside directors, is responsible for reviewing and monitoring the Company's financial reporting and accounting practices. The Audit Committee meets periodically with management, the Company's internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each group is carrying out its respective responsibilities. In addition, the independent registered public accounting firm has full and free access to the Audit Committee and meet with it with no representatives from management present.

## Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

As stated above, the Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company's management has evaluated the system of internal control using the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework ('COSO 2013 framework'). Management has selected the COSO 2013 framework for its evaluation as it is a control framework recognized by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board that is free from bias, permits reasonably consistent qualitative and quantitative measurement of the Company's internal controls, is sufficiently complete so that relevant controls are not omitted and is relevant to an evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting.

Based on management's evaluation under this framework, we have concluded that the Company's internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2024. There are no material weaknesses in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that have been identified by management.

The Company's independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst &amp; Young LLP , has audited the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2024, and has issued their reports on the financial statements and the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting.

## Other Matters

There have been no changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting during the most recent quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

This image presents a handwritten signature, likely intended for biometric authentication or document verification. The key features are the stroke dynamics, including pen pressure variations, stroke direction, and overall shape of each character. The signature exhibits variations in line thickness, indicating changes in applied force during writing. The relative positions and connections between characters are also critical features. The engineering implication is that a biometric system analyzing this signature would need to capture and process these dynamic features to accurately authenticate the signatory, requiring sensors capable of measuring pressure and precise movement tracking algorithms. The system's performance will depend on its ability to distinguish between genuine signatures and forgeries based on these subtle, yet critical, variations.

## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

## To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of S&amp;P Global Inc.

## Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of S&amp;P Global Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the 'consolidated financial statements'). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 11, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

## Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

## Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

## Valuation of redeemable noncontrolling interest in S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC

## DESCRIPTION OF THE MATTER

## HOW WE ADDRESSED THE MATTER IN OUR AUDIT

As described in Notes 1 and 9 to the financial statements, the Company has an agreement with the minority partners of its S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture that contains redemption features outside of the control of the Company. This arrangement is reported as a redeemable noncontrolling interest at fair value of $4,239 million at December 31, 2024. The Company adjusts the redeemable noncontrolling interest each reporting period to its estimated redemption value, but never less than its initial fair value, using both income and market valuation approaches.

Auditing the Company's valuation of its redeemable noncontrolling interest was complex due to the estimation uncertainty in determining the fair value. The estimation uncertainty was primarily due to the sensitivity of the fair value to underlying assumptions about the future performance of the business. The more significant judgmental assumptions used to estimate the value of the S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture include an estimated discount rate, a range of assumptions that form the basis of the expected future net cash flows (e.g., revenue growth rates and operating margins), a company specific beta and earnings and transaction multiples for comparable companies and similar acquisitions, respectively. These significant judgmental assumptions that incorporate market data are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's controls over the accounting for its redeemable noncontrolling interest, including controls over management's judgments and evaluation of the underlying assumptions with regard to the valuation models applied and the estimation process supporting the determination of the fair value of S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture.

To test the valuation of redeemable noncontrolling interest, we evaluated the Company's selection of the valuation methodology and the methods and significant assumptions used by inspecting available market data and performing sensitivity analyses. For example, when evaluating the assumptions related to the revenue growth rate and operating profit margins, we compared the assumptions to the past performance of S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture in addition to current observable industry, market and economic trends. We involved valuation specialists to assist in our evaluation of the methodology and significant assumptions used by the Company, including the discount rate, company specific beta and earnings for comparable companies and transaction multiples for similar acquisitions.  We also tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions and estimates.

## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

## To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of S&amp;P Global Inc.

## Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited S&amp;P Global Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, S&amp;P Global Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 11, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

## Basis for Opinion

The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

This figure is a certification label indicating the source of paper used in a product. The label signifies that the paper originates from a mix of sources, including Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified forests, recycled materials, and/or controlled wood. The presence of the FSC logo and associated website address indicates adherence to FSC standards for responsible forest management. The "MIX" designation specifies that the paper is not exclusively from FSC-certified forests but includes a blend of sources meeting certain sustainability criteria. The unique certification code (FSC C103265) allows for traceability of the paper's origin and verification of the supplier's compliance with FSC standards. The implication for engineering design is that the product incorporates materials sourced with environmental considerations, potentially influencing material selection and supply chain management decisions to align with sustainability goals.
