The provided figure is a projection map centered on the North Pole, overlaid with a grid system. The primary objective is to represent the Earth's surface on a two-dimensional plane, enabling spatial analysis and geographic referencing. The map projection displays continents and oceans, with landmasses depicted in solid black. A polar grid system is superimposed, consisting of concentric circles emanating from the North Pole and radial lines extending outwards. The grid facilitates the determination of relative locations and distances. The projection inherently introduces distortion, particularly at lower latitudes, which must be considered when performing measurements or spatial calculations. This representation is useful for visualizing global coverage and understanding spatial relationships from a polar perspective, but requires careful interpretation due to projection-induced distortions.

The figure presents a document identifier string, "ECE/TRANS/180/Add.21". This string is a hierarchical identifier, likely referencing a specific document within a larger organizational structure. The components are "ECE" (likely the organization), "TRANS" (possibly a division or committee), "180" (a document or series number), and "Add.21" (an addendum or revision number). The implication for engineering design documentation is that this identifier should be used to accurately reference and retrieve the specified document, ensuring that the correct version and relevant information are used in the design process. This is critical for traceability, compliance, and avoiding errors due to outdated or incorrect information.

1. Context: The figure is a diagram representing a closed-loop material flow system, specifically a recycling process. The primary objective is to illustrate the cyclical nature of material reuse and its potential for resource conservation.
2. Deconstruction: The diagram consists of three arrows arranged in a triangular formation, each pointing towards the next. This configuration symbolizes a continuous loop. The arrows represent the stages of the recycling process: collection, processing, and manufacturing. The closed-loop nature indicates that materials are continuously reintroduced into the production cycle, minimizing waste and reducing the need for virgin resources.
3. Implication: The diagram highlights the importance of designing products for recyclability and establishing efficient collection and processing infrastructure. It emphasizes the potential for reducing environmental impact through closed-loop material management. This implies that design considerations should include material selection, disassembly, and compatibility with existing recycling technologies to facilitate effective material recovery and reuse.

Here's a technical summary of the QR code image:

The figure is a Quick Response (QR) code, a two-dimensional barcode designed to encode data for rapid machine readability. The code consists of a square grid of black and white modules arranged in a specific pattern. Key features include three large finder patterns located in three corners of the symbol, enabling rapid detection and orientation. A smaller alignment pattern is also present to compensate for perspective distortion. The remaining modules encode the data, error correction information, and format information. The density of the modules determines the data capacity of the QR code. The engineering implication is that this QR code can be used to efficiently encode a specific data string, allowing for quick and reliable data transfer via optical scanning. The data encoded can be decoded using a QR code reader application, enabling automated data input and retrieval in various applications.

- I. Statement of technical rationale and justification
- A. Introduction
1. Passenger vehicles are commonly assigned a vehicle power rating, which is useful for comparing the performance of different vehicles. Vehicle power rating has also been used for  other  purposes  such  as  vehicle  classification,  customer  information,  insurance,  and taxation.
2. Historically, almost every passenger vehicle produced for the consumer market has been powered exclusively by an internal combustion engine (ICE). The vehicle power rating assigned to these conventional vehicles has customarily been the same as the rated power of the engine, as determined by an engine bench test. This is a convenient way to assign a power rating to a vehicle, because the engine power rating may then be applied to any vehicle that uses the same engine.
3. As a measure of real-world vehicle performance, this traditional measure is imperfect, since it does not account for the power lost in the drivetrain between the engine and the road. However, it has become well established and is generally accepted as a useful metric, in part because conventional vehicles have only one engine, and its full rated power is typically available for propulsion.
4. Today, electrified vehicles such as hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and pure electric vehicles (PEVs) with multiple drive motors represent an increasing share of the market. A vehicle power rating is not as easy to assign to these vehicles because they combine more than one propulsion source, such as an engine and an electric machine, or multiple electric machines.
5. For these vehicles, the available power depends on how the control system combines the power of each propulsion source when the driver demands maximum power. While it may seem that this would simply be the sum of the rated power of each component, this is not necessarily valid in practice. It will result in an overestimate if, for example, the electric machine is limited by the available battery power, or if the control system limits or reassigns some of the nominal capacity, such as to maintain traction or charge the battery.
6. Owing to the pressing need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) and other air pollutants, the market share of electrified vehicles is expected to grow in the future. This intensifies the need for a standard method for assigning a vehicle power rating to electrified vehicles.
7. Electrified vehicles and conventional vehicles are likely to coexist in the market for some  time.  Many  existing  regulations  and  procedures,  such  as  WLTP,  apply  to  both conventional and electrified vehicles, and require a power rating as an input. In order to be used  equitably  for  such  purposes,  a  power  rating  for  electrified  vehicles  should  be qualitatively and quantitatively comparable with the traditional engine-based power ratings of conventional vehicles.
- B. Technical background
1. Primary technical challenges
8. Developing  a  test  procedure  and  system  power  rating  that  fits  the  requirements presents two primary technical challenges:

(a) The first challenge is to identify a reliable and repeatable way to command a vehicle to deliver maximum power in a laboratory setting. (b) The second challenge is to identify a comparable and valid basis for the system power rating and to identify the measurements and calculations necessary to produce it.

3

ECE/TRANS/180/Add.21

- (a) Commanding maximum power
9. As part of their standards development efforts, SAE and ISO studied ways to elicit maximum power in a laboratory setting (more details about the Informal Working Group (IWG) on Electric Vehicle and the Environment (EVE), SAE and ISO activities related to the topic of power measurement of electrified powertrain can be found in the technical report of this UN GTR). This resulted in identification of a reliable and repeatable method to do this by use  of  the  fixed-speed  setting  of  a  chassis  dynamometer.  The  condition  of  maximum power  is  determined  by  driving  the  vehicle  on  the  dynamometer  at  a  series  of  fixed dynamometer speeds to find the maximum brake power of the dynamometer that the vehicle is able to run against. At each speed, the accelerator is rapidly and fully depressed for at least 10 seconds. The speed at which the dynamometer records the highest power is recorded. The system power is then determined at this fixed dynamometer speed.

## (b) Basis and measurements

10. In early discussions, the IWG on EVE discussed a number of conceptually simple measurement bases for electrified vehicle power.
11. One very simple basis would simply measure the peak power delivered to the wheels. This  would  be  compatible  with  all  electrified  vehicles  regardless  of  their  powertrain architecture. If also extended to conventional vehicles, it would rate all vehicles on a directly comparable basis, and would represent real-world power more effectively than the traditional measure because it includes the effect of losses in the drivetrain. However, for the same reason, this would result in power ratings that are not comparable to the traditional measure, which continues to be used in many applications.
12. Another simple approach would measure the peak power delivered to the wheels and then  adjust  it  by  an  assumed  transmission  efficiency.  This  approach  recognizes  that  an engine-based power rating, in theory, should be identical to the peak power delivered to the wheels divided by the mechanical conversion efficiency of the drivetrain (e.g. gearbox or transmission).  By  extension,  a  highly  comparable  power  rating  for  an  electrified  vehicle could be determined by measuring the peak power delivered to the wheels and dividing by a typical (conventional) drivetrain efficiency at peak load, perhaps 90 to 95 percent. However, it was not clear that this approach would represent all hybrid powertrains equally, nor that a single assumed drivetrain efficiency would represent all comparison vehicles equally.
13. Another possibility  would  sum  the  power  of  the  engine  with  the  measured  power output of the battery. Many hybrid vehicles operate the engine at full throttle when the driver demands maximum power, meaning that engine power can be estimated from engine speed by reference to a full load power curve. Battery power is also reasonably simple to measure, and measuring at the battery avoids the need to instrument individual inverters or motors. However, it would neglect electrical conversion losses in the latter, and so might tend to produce optimistic results for highly electrified powertrains.
14. Recognizing  that  these  relatively  simple  methods  vary  in  their  comparability  and fairness, the IWG on EVE sought to identify a more sophisticated approach.
15. Conceptually, a comparable and fair rating would be based on the power that passes through the powertrain at a point that  is  mechanically  analogous  to  the output  shaft  of a conventional engine (as opposed to the wheels or the battery, where the losses would be different). Intuitively, this point would include the mechanical output shafts of any propulsion energy converters (i.e. engine and electric machines) that contribute propulsion energy when the driver commands maximum power.
16. As an example, Figure 1 illustrates a typical P2 hybrid configuration, in which ICE power and electric motor power is mechanically combined on a single shaft. It identifies two "reference  points,"  R1  and  R2,  which  together  are  mechanically  analogous  to  the  power output of the engine in a conventional vehicle. That is, they represent where the mechanical power that drives the wheels is first produced from stored energy. The goal would be to determine the sum of the mechanical power passing through R1 and R2 when the vehicle is producing maximum power.

Figure 1

## Example of reference points for system power determination

The figure is a schematic diagram representing the powertrain architecture of a parallel hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). It illustrates the flow of mechanical power from two sources, an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) and an Electric Motor (EM), to the vehicle's wheels. The EM is powered by a Rechargeable Energy Storage System (REESS) via an Inverter (Inv). The ICE and EM are mechanically coupled to the transmission through two clutches, R1 and R2, respectively. The transmission then transfers power to the wheels. The diagram highlights the parallel configuration, where both the ICE and EM can independently or simultaneously drive the wheels. This configuration allows for various operating modes, including electric-only, ICE-only, and combined power. The presence of two clutches (R1 and R2) enables precise control over the power contribution from each source. The key engineering insight is the flexibility in power delivery and energy management offered by this parallel hybrid architecture, enabling optimization for fuel efficiency and performance.

17. In theory, the most direct approach to measure the power at R1 and R2 would be to instrument the corresponding shafts with torque and speed meters. However, this requires invasive instrumentation, may not be possible in some cases, and is unlikely to be practical in a type approval context.
18. A  more  practical  approach  would  measure  power  flow  at  other  points  in  the powertrain that are easier to instrument, and estimate the power at reference points R1 and R2 by accounting for the losses between the measuring points and the reference points. As shown in Figure 2, the measuring points could either be upstream or downstream of the reference  points.  An  option  for  measuring  upstream  (option  1)  might  include  measuring engine speed and converting it to the mechanical power output at R1, and measuring REESS power output and converting it to the power at R2 by accounting for electrical conversion losses. Options for measuring downstream (option 2) might include measuring the power delivered to the axle by means of wheel torque and speed sensors or a hub dynamometer, and then determining the sum of R1 and R2 by accounting for mechanical conversion losses in the drivetrain.

Figure 2 Possible measurement points to estimate power at R1 and R2 for parallel P2 hybrid

1.  Context: The figure is a block diagram representing the power flow and energy conversion stages in a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) powertrain. Its primary objective is to illustrate the energy path from the energy sources (REESS and ICE) to the wheels, highlighting key components and energy conversion losses.

2.  Deconstruction: The diagram shows two energy sources: a Rechargeable Energy Storage System (REESS) and an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE). The REESS connects to an Inverter (Inv) and then to an Electric Motor (EM). The ICE's output is measured in rev/min and is subject to UNR 85 testing. The EM and ICE outputs are mechanically coupled, driving the wheels through a transmission. The diagram identifies two measurement points: one at the REESS output and another at the wheels. The diagram also highlights electrical conversion losses between the REESS and EM, and mechanical conversion losses between the ICE/EM and the wheels. R1 and R2 are points of mechanical coupling between the ICE and EM.

3.  Implication: The diagram emphasizes the importance of minimizing energy conversion losses in both the electrical and mechanical domains to improve overall powertrain efficiency. The measurement points indicate locations for performance monitoring and system optimization. The coupling points R1 and R2 are critical for managing torque distribution between the ICE and EM. The UNR 85 test results for the ICE are important for regulatory compliance and performance characterization.

Note: measurement point for option 2 represents both axle shafts.

19. Electrified powertrains vary widely, and can include power flow paths that are much more complex than those depicted here. However, once the reference points are identified, it should  be  possible  to  estimate  the  power  at  the  reference  points  by  taking  appropriate measurements when the vehicle is generating maximum power, and accounting for the losses between the measurement points and the reference points using component test data or sound engineering judgement.

ECE/TRANS/180/Add.21

2. Accuracy and precision
20. It should be noted that the traditional engine-based metric does not perfectly represent the road power available to the driver, because it neglects losses in the transmission. This also makes it imprecise, in that the road power may vary significantly from one vehicle model to another due to differences in drivetrain losses.
21. Engine power ratings are also somewhat imprecise. For example, UN Regulation No. 85 allows the declared power value for a production engine to vary by ± 2 percent from the certification test result, and by ± 5 percent for conformity of production.
22. A system power metric for electrified vehicles might therefore be held to a similar level of accuracy and precision.
3. Work of other organizations
23. The IWG on EVE received presentations from experts with several organizations that were studying the problem of hybrid system power determination.

## (a) SAE J2908

24. The SAE J2908 Task Force led by Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) started its project in November 2014. Three primary methods of determining HEV system power were initially investigated (referred to here as Method 1, Method 2, and Method 3).
25. SAE Method 1 was the sum of engine power (estimated from bench test results) and measured DC power from the battery (neglecting electrical conversion losses in the inverter and electric machines). SAE Method 2 was the sum of estimated shaft powers from the engine and the electric machines (determined from bench test results and onboard data, respectively). SAE Method 3 was the measured power at the axle or wheel.
26. The IWG on EVE agreed with the characterization of these three primary methods as reasonable approaches to measure system power. However, the three methods varied in terms of how well the measure could be compared to the traditional power ratings for conventional vehicles, and in terms of the ability to verify a reported value. Method 1 was conceptually similar to the conventional engine-based rating and would be straightforward to verify by measurement, but neglected some losses. Method 2 was most comparable to the conventional rating, but would impose the highest burden of instrumentation to verify. Method 3 would be easily verifiable by dynamometer testing, but because a wheel power measurement accounts for losses in the drivetrain, it would not be as comparable to the conventional rating, which does not.

## (b) KATRI standard

27. KATRI started a research project in July 2013 with the aim of developing a national standard  for  the  determination  of  a  representative  power  for  (Non)  Off-Vehicle  Charge ((N)OVC)-HEVs and PEVs with in-wheel motors. It was completed in June 2015. Nominal rating and system power tests were studied using a powertrain dynamometer or a chassis dynamometer with added instrumentation. The definition of hybrid system power follows the same approach as SAE Method 1, namely that it involves a simple addition of the rated engine power and the electric power of the battery. The engine power is the rated power according to UN Regulation No. 85. The electric power is the measured power of the fully charged REESS, determined by chassis dynamometer testing. Compared to the SAE methodology, it is a somewhat more sophisticated test that provides not only accurate measurement of wheel or axle power but also system torque.

## (c) ISO 20762

28. ISO conducted a project under New Work Item Proposal (NWIP) N3477 proposed by the Japan Automobile Research Institute (JARI), approved in June 2015. It started as a formal project of ISO/ TC22/SC37/WG02 and was finalized as ISO Standard 20762 in 2018.
29. The ISO method includes two alternative test procedures, referred to as test procedure 1 (TP1) and test procedure 2 (TP2).

6

30. As shown in Figure 3, TP1 is based on upstream measurements at the engine and REESS, and TP2 is based on a downstream measurement at the wheel hubs or axle shafts.

Figure 3 Measurement points for ISO test procedures TP1 and TP2

Note: measurement point for TP2 represents both axle shafts.

1.  Context: The figure is a schematic diagram representing the powertrain architecture of a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). Its primary objective is to illustrate the mechanical power flow and component arrangement within the drivetrain, including the energy storage system, internal combustion engine, electric motor, and transmission.

2.  Deconstruction: The diagram depicts an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) and a Rechargeable Energy Storage System (REESS) connected to a drivetrain. The REESS is connected to an electric motor (EM) via an inverter (Inv). The ICE and EM are connected to the drivetrain via junctions R1 and R2, respectively. The drivetrain includes a transmission (K2) and axles connected to the wheels. Measurement points TP1 and TP2 are indicated at the REESS output and the wheel axle, respectively. The ICE has a rev/min indicator and is labeled as being subject to UNR 85 test results.

3.  Implication: The diagram highlights a parallel hybrid configuration where both the ICE and EM can independently or jointly provide power to the wheels. The measurement points TP1 and TP2 are critical for evaluating the system's energy efficiency and performance characteristics. The UNR 85 test results for the ICE are important for regulatory compliance and emissions analysis. The junctions R1 and R2 are critical for understanding the power split between the ICE and EM. The transmission K2 is critical for understanding the gear ratios and torque multiplication.

![Image](ref_artifacts/image_000006_d05cc57bebf117d6f9592f7507ac306d9a842766edab47f1a94f9611036f36b3.png)

31. TP1 is similar to SAE Method 1, but additionally accounts for electrical conversion losses. Total power is the sum of estimated engine power and estimated motor power. Engine power is the rated power by ISO 1585 (or UN Regulation No. 85) at the observed operating point. Motor power is based on measured REESS power, adjusted by a factor (known as K, with a default value of 0.85) that represents combined efficiency of the inverter(s) and electric machine(s). (Electrical power to the accessories is also estimated or measured and deducted from the REESS power.) Figure 4 illustrates how total power is modelled under TP1.
32. TP2 is similar to SAE Method 3. Total power is the power measured at the wheels or axle shafts, adjusted by a factor (known as ηgb) that represents losses in the gearbox. Default values for ηgb are provided for a number of hybrid drivetrains. Figure 5 illustrates how total power is modeled under TP2.

Figure 4 TP1 as sum of estimated engine power and estimated motor power

1.  Context: The figure is a time-series plot illustrating the power contribution of different components in a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) powertrain during a transient event, likely a rapid acceleration. The primary objective is to analyze the power distribution between the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE), the Rechargeable Energy Storage System (REESS), and the electric motor over time.
2.  Deconstruction: The x-axis represents time in seconds, ranging from -0.5 to 2.5 seconds. The y-axis represents power in kilowatts (kW), ranging from 0 to 200 kW. The plot shows four curves: "Total power," "ICE power (estimated)," "REESS power (measured)," and "Motor power." All power curves start at 0 kW at t=0s. The "Total power" curve rises sharply, reaching a peak around 185 kW at approximately 1 second, then decreases slightly and stabilizes around 170 kW. The "ICE power" curve rises to approximately 110 kW and remains relatively constant. The "REESS power" curve rises to a peak of approximately 90 kW around 0.8 seconds, then decreases. The "Motor power" curve rises to a peak of approximately 75 kW around 0.8 seconds, then decreases.
3.  Implication: The plot reveals that during the initial acceleration phase, the REESS and motor provide a significant power boost in addition to the ICE, contributing to the high "Total power." As time progresses, the REESS and motor power decrease, while the ICE power remains relatively constant, indicating a shift in power source dominance. The design implication is that the REESS and motor are crucial for transient performance, while the ICE sustains steady-state power demands. The REESS capacity and motor power rating must be sufficient to meet the peak power demands during acceleration.

ECE/TRANS/180/Add.21

## Figure 5 TP2 as measured wheel power adjusted for losses in gearbox

1.  Context: The figure is a plot showing power (kW) versus time (s) for a vehicle's wheel power and total power adjustment during a transient event, likely acceleration. The primary objective is to characterize the power delivery profile and quantify the difference between the measured wheel power and the total power adjustment.
2.  Deconstruction: The x-axis represents time in seconds, ranging from -0.5 to 2.5. The y-axis represents power in kilowatts (kW), ranging from 0 to 200. Two curves are plotted: "Wheel power (measured)" (dotted line) and "Total power adjustment" (solid line). Both curves start at 0 kW and rapidly increase between 0 and 0.5 seconds. The wheel power reaches a peak around 175 kW at approximately 1.5 seconds, then decreases slightly. The total power adjustment reaches a peak around 188 kW at approximately 1.5 seconds, then decreases slightly. The difference between the two curves represents the power losses in the system.
3.  Implication: The plot reveals the transient power response of the vehicle. The difference between the total power adjustment and the wheel power indicates the magnitude of power losses within the drivetrain and other systems. This information is crucial for optimizing system efficiency, thermal management, and component sizing. The time to peak power is also a key performance indicator.

![Image](ref_artifacts/image_000008_c6f76b5e0c6cb129cc4154b387436b05f4dcd6738b91339ec3d4f76f024d7dae.png)

33. It  could  be  said  that  TP1  and  TP2  provide  the  flexibility  in  measurement  options provided by SAE Method 1 and 3, while the inclusion of the adjustment factors K and ηgb result in a metric more like that of SAE Method 2, which is most comparable to the traditional measure.
34. In both TP1 and TP2, power is measured when the hybrid system as a whole delivers maximum  power  on  a  dynamometer  running  at  a  fixed  speed.  If  not  provided  by  the manufacturer,  the  fixed  speed  at  which  maximum  power  is  delivered  is  determined  by carrying out a series of test runs while driving the vehicle on the dynamometer at a series of fixed speeds to find the maximum brake power of the dynamometer that the vehicle is able to run against. At each speed, the accelerator is rapidly and fully depressed for at least 10 seconds.
35. As shown in Figure 6, the tests result in a power-versus-speed curve that helps to identify the fixed dynamometer speed at which maximum power is generated. If necessary, the evaluation is continued with smaller speed steps near the peak of the curve until the speed of the peak power is accurately identified. The power test is then performed at this fixed speed.

## Figure 6 Identification of speed of maximum vehicle power

1.  Context: The figure is a plot of power output (kW) versus fixed dynamometer speed (km/hr), aiming to characterize the power delivery profile of a system under varying speed conditions.
2.  Deconstruction: The x-axis represents fixed dynamometer speed, ranging from 20 to 150 km/hr. The y-axis represents power output, ranging from 60 to 200 kW. The plot shows a non-linear relationship: power output increases with speed up to a maximum point, then decreases as speed further increases. The maximum power output of approximately 185 kW occurs at a speed of approximately 90 km/hr.
3.  Implication: The plot reveals that the system's peak performance is achieved at a specific speed. System design should prioritize operation around 90 km/hr to maximize power output. Operation at speeds significantly deviating from this point will result in reduced power delivery.

36. Calculations are then performed to determine the system power according to TP1 or TP2. As shown in Figure 7, a "peak" power is defined as the maximum value of a 2-second moving  average  of  the  total  power  over  a  10  second  window  beginning  at  the  start  of

8

- maximum accelerator command, and a "sustained" power is the average total power between the 8th and 10th seconds.
4. Selection of ISO methodology
37. The  IWG  on  EVE  recognized  that  the  ISO  method  showed  good  comparability, flexibility, and verifiability. At the 22 nd  meeting of the IWG on EVE, the contracting parties reached consensus that the ISO approach presented the best option as a basis to fulfill the needs of the mandate.
5. Integration and validation
38. The IWG on EVE then turned attention to aligning and integrating the ISO method with UN GTR No. 15, or developing a new GTR. There was some debate as to whether the GTR should select only one of the ISO test procedures (TP1 or TP2) or retain both options. It  was  generally  decided  that  retaining  both  would  be  preferable  because  it  would accommodate  variations  in  vehicle  instrumentation  possibilities  and  differing  laboratory capabilities or preferences.
39. The IWG on EVE recognized that retention of both procedures meant that differences between the two test results should be minimized in order to prevent inconsistent results and the opportunity for selective reporting (or "cherry picking").
40. In  designing  and  validating  the  ISO  method,  the  ISO  committee  placed  strong emphasis on its practicability. Testing at the Japan Automotive Research Institute (JARI) indicated that the procedures delivered equivalent results for a variety of HEVs, although TP2 was thought to show somewhat greater variability than TP1. Discussion in the IWG suggested  that  the  relative  variability  may  be  the  result  of  TP2  being  based  entirely  on measured data, while a large component of TP1 relies on a fixed value for engine power obtained from the UN Regulation No. 85 rated power. If so, then the relative variability may be a natural outcome of differences in the procedures.
41. The IWG on EVE recognized that additional validation testing would be necessary to assess this and other potential sources of variability, and also to validate the ability of  the aligned ISO method to fulfil the specific needs of a regulatory application.
42. Several  contracting  parties  volunteered  to  perform  validation  testing,  including Environment  and  Climate  Change  Canada  (ECCC),  Joint  Research  Centre  (JRC),  U.  S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and KATRI.
43. A first phase of the validation program was initiated at the April 2018 IWG on EVE meeting in Tokyo. Japan reviewed the testing performed on three HEVs in conjunction with development of the ISO standard in 2016. A matrix of additional HEVs that were available

Figure 7 Definition of peak and sustained power

1.  Context: The figure is a time-series plot illustrating the power output of a system over an 11-second interval. The primary objective is to characterize the power profile, including peak, sustained, and total power, as well as a 2-second moving average.
2.  Deconstruction: The x-axis represents time in seconds, and the y-axis represents power in kilowatts (kW). The solid line depicts the instantaneous total power, while the dashed line represents the 2-second moving average of the power. The plot shows a rapid power increase from 0 kW to a peak of approximately 190 kW within the first second. The power then decreases slightly to a sustained level of around 170 kW, which is maintained until approximately the 8th second. From the 10th second onwards, the power rapidly decreases back to 0 kW.
3.  Implication: The plot reveals critical design parameters, including the peak power demand (190 kW), the sustained power requirement (170 kW), and the duration of the sustained power phase (approximately 8 seconds). The 2-second moving average provides insight into the short-term power fluctuations. These values are essential for sizing power supply components, thermal management systems, and energy storage solutions to meet the system's operational demands.

ECE/TRANS/180/Add.21

- for testing was compiled. US EPA offered to perform testing of a Belted Alternator Starter (BAS) hybrid and a power split PHEV. Canada offered to perform testing of a later generation power split HEV, a P2 hybrid, and a two-motor PEV. KATRI offered to perform testing on a  P2  hybrid.  JRC  offered  to  perform  testing  on  two  parallel  hybrid  vehicles  provided  by representatives from Volvo and Hyundai.
44. Japan arranged for consultation with the engineer who performed the ISO validation tests  in  Japan.  A  detailed  technical  report  on  this  testing  had  been  prepared  in  Japanese. Canada agreed to arrange for translation of the report into English. JRC scheduled an initial round of testing at the facilities in Ispra, Italy in 2018, which was attended by representatives from USA and Japan as well as technical support personnel from Volvo and Hyundai.
45. Due to the short time frame available, and the knowledge that the ISO committee had already  performed  significant  validation,  the  validation  testing  focused  primarily  on practicability of the procedure as currently written, and the effect of default assumptions and available flexibilities on the consistency of the results. To save time, testing was limited to vehicles  that  were  readily  available  at  the  participating  test  labs  and  calculations  were performed using the specified default values for K (later renamed K1) and ηgb (renamed K2). In some cases, measurements were gathered from onboard systems rather than instrumentation due to resource constraints. While the measurements were believed to be sufficiently  accurate,  it  was  not  always  possible  to  validate  onboard  measurements  for accuracy.
46. The  results  of  the  first  phase  of  validation  revealed  significant  and  unexpected differences between the results of TP1 and TP2 for many of the vehicles tested. Accordingly, the work of the IWG began to focus on identifying the sources of these differences, their implications, and how to reduce or eliminate them.
6. Causes of differences between TP1 and TP2 observed in Phase 1 of validation
47. The IWG on EVE identified several potential causes for the observed differences:

(a) Variation in accuracy of default values for K1 and K2 as applied to specific vehicle models. (b) Uncertainty in accuracy of measurements and measurement options. (c) Variation in power of production engines compared to UN Regulation No. 85 test results. (d) Influence of powertrain architecture on necessary measurements to perform TP1 or TP2 in an equivalent manner.

- (a) Default values for K1 and K2
48. For a given powertrain architecture and vehicle model, the relative accuracy of the fixed default values for K1 and K2 are likely to vary, leading to differences in the accuracy with which each TP accounts for losses, and thereby leading to a difference in the results.
49. In particular, the default K1 value of 0.85 sometimes appeared to produce lower power ratings for TP1, depending on the fraction of total power contributed by electricity. For one vehicle that was propelled entirely by electrical power, the power rating delivered by TP1 was smaller than the power measured at the wheels (which would erroneously suggest a drivetrain efficiency greater than 100 percent). Modifying the K1 value to a different value that was still consistent with the powertrain design made the result much closer to that of TP2.
50. For  some  powertrain  architectures,  the  applicable  default  K2  factor  for  TP2  was unclear. Two of the test laboratories independently chose to employ different K2 values for an architecture that included series and parallel elements.
51. It was anticipated that the predefined list of default K2 factors may be insufficient to represent potential architectures that may emerge in the future. In particular, Japan pointed out that it is uncertain whether the default value for K2 would apply to different variations in power split hybrid architectures.

10

## (b) Accuracy of measurements

52. Some of the validation tests relied on TP1 measurements that were based on onboard network data that could not be verified because physical instrumentation for current and voltage  was  not  available.  While  believed  to  be  accurate,  any  inaccuracy  could  have contributed to the difference between TP1 and TP2.
53. Measurements for TP2 were taken from dynamometer rollers and therefore included tire  losses.  While  the  test  procedure  permitted  the  use  of  roller  data  if  tire  losses  were accounted  for,  it  did  not  specify  a  method  for  determining  tire  losses.  Evidence  of  tire slippage was observed, which may have introduced additional unaccounted losses.

## (c) Variability of UN Regulation No. 85 engine power

54. TP1 may be affected by allowable variation in engine power from UN Regulation No. 85 test results. According to Section 5.4 of UN Regulation No. 85 (Interpretation of results), the declared power output of production engines certified under UN Regulation No. 85 is permitted to vary by ± 2 percent from the test result, suggesting that some error is possible even if the measured engine speed and intake manifold pressure match perfectly with those reported in UN Regulation No. 85. This uncertainty is unique to TP1 and so could contribute to the observed variation between TP1 and TP2.
55. Further, TP1's estimation of engine power based on measured speed  relies on the assumption that the engine is operating at its maximum power for that speed, and that the power can be accurately reconstructed by reference to engine test results (e.g. UN Regulation No. 85). Measurements of intake manifold pressure and fuel flow rate are compared to the engine test result to verify that the engine operating state is consistent with maximum power. However, the test procedure did not specify the permissible variation, leading to uncertainty in the engine power portion of TP1.
56. Some experts noted that intake manifold pressure is not highly sensitive to power output at the constant engine speed that results from the procedure, and therefore it is not highly effective at confirming the result. It was recommended that measurement of fuel flow rate also be required for verification of UN Regulation No. 85 engine power.

## (d) Influence of powertrain architecture

57. ISO 20762 does not mention the concept of reference points, although reference points are  implied  by  the  details  of  the  procedure.  When  the  concept  of  reference  points  was introduced and applied rigorously, it was found that for some powertrain architectures, the then-prescribed calculations for TP1 and TP2 may have been estimating power at slightly different reference points, leading to variation between the results.
58. As shown in Figure 8, both TP1 and TP2 apply well to a parallel P2 HEV. Here, the system power is the sum of the power at R1 and R2. The K1 and K2 factors represent the conversion efficiencies of simple component combinations, and so are relatively simple to determine and verify. TP1 determines engine power at R1 by reference to speed and  UN Regulation No. 85 results, and determines the power at R2 by measuring power from the REESS (subtracting accessory power) and applying the K1 efficiency factor. Alternatively, TP2 determines the sum of the power at R1 and R2 by measuring power at the axle shafts and applying K2. If the applicable measurements and K factors are equally accurate, then for this powertrain architecture, TP1 and TP2 should always deliver the same answer for the sum of R1 and R2.

Figure 8 Parallel P2 hybrid with one electric machine, measurable by TP1 and TP2

1.  Context: The figure is a schematic diagram representing the powertrain architecture of a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) and its associated measurement points for testing. The primary objective is to illustrate the flow of power from the energy sources (REESS and ICE) to the wheels and identify locations for data acquisition during UNR 85 testing.
2.  Deconstruction: The diagram shows two energy sources: a Rechargeable Energy Storage System (REESS) and an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE). The REESS connects to an Inverter (Inv) and Electric Motor (EM) assembly (K1). The ICE output and EM output are connected via a junction (R2) to a transmission (K2) and then to the wheels. R1 indicates the point where the ICE's rotational speed (rev/min) is measured. TP1 and TP2 indicate measurement points for REESS and wheel respectively.
3.  Implication: The diagram highlights the parallel hybrid configuration, where both the ICE and EM can independently or jointly power the vehicle. The measurement points (TP1, TP2, R1) are critical for validating the HEV's performance and compliance with UNR 85 testing standards. The diagram informs the placement of sensors and data acquisition systems for powertrain analysis and control system development.

Note: measurement point for TP2 represents both axle shafts.

59. However, in the case of some other architectures, the specified measurements for TP1 or TP2 may be difficult to convert to a common reference point.
60. As shown in Figure 9, the Toyota Hybrid System (THS) utilizes a planetary gear set with  multiple  inputs  and  outputs.  Under  maximum  power  demand,  engine  power  enters through the planet gear carrier (P), then is split between the ring gear (where it goes directly to  the  wheels)  and  the  sun  gear  S  (where  it  enters  a  series  path  that  eventually  delivers additional torque to the ring gear for delivery to the wheels).

Figure 9 Power split hybrid, ambiguous under TP2

## P = planet carrier and gears; S = sun gear; Ring = ring gear

1.  Context: The figure is a schematic diagram representing the power flow within a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) powertrain. It illustrates the interaction between an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE), a Regenerative Electrical Energy Storage System (REESS), and a Motor Generator (MG) to drive the vehicle's wheels. The diagram aims to depict the mechanical and electrical power transmission paths and their interdependencies.

2.  Deconstruction: The diagram shows the ICE connected to a planetary gear set (S, P, Ring) and the MG connected to the ring gear. The REESS is connected to the MG via Inverter 1 (Inv1) and to the ICE via Inverter 2 (Inv2) and Generator (G). Red arrows indicate mechanical power flow from the ICE, while blue arrows represent electrical power flow from the REESS. The purple arrow indicates the combined power flow from the ICE and MG to the wheels. R1 and R2 represent gear ratios. TP1 and TP2 are measurement points.

3.  Implication: The diagram highlights the parallel hybrid architecture, where both the ICE and MG can independently or jointly power the wheels. The gear ratios R1 and R2 are critical design parameters for optimizing torque and speed characteristics. The REESS provides energy for electric drive and captures energy during regenerative braking. The measurement points TP1 and TP2 are important for validating the powertrain model and performance. The unknown gear ratio K2 needs to be determined for complete system analysis.

![Image](ref_artifacts/image_000012_1751a82592bc90a9c85a77236688a7a0c0c84f17e9a32ee928eebc56a93d3694.png)

Note: measurement point for TP2 represents both axle shafts.

61. With careful consideration, reference points that are most  comparable to a conventional  vehicle  can  be  identified.  Reference  point  R1  represents  where  mechanical power from the engine is first produced. From here, the engine power splits to the series path and  the  direct-to-wheels  path,  which  together  may  be  considered  as  a  sort  of  electromechanical transmission, and therefore, as with the transmission of a conventional vehicle, is not subject to further accounting.
62. Another reference point must be established to account for the contribution of the REESS. REESS power is first produced as mechanical power at the output shaft of motorgenerator MG; however, at this point it has been combined with power contributed by the engine series path (which is already accounted for via R1). To prevent double counting, the second reference point is therefore called R2REESS, and represents the portion of MG power that is attributable to the REESS.

63. TP1 is straightforward for this architecture. The power at R1 is determined from UN Regulation No.  85 results,  and  R2REESS  is  the  measured  REESS  power  multiplied  by  K1 (where K1 is the electrical conversion efficiency of the total power flow through Inv1 and MG). System power is the sum of R1 and R2REESS.
64. TP2 is not as straightforward here. TP2 relies on a measure of total power at the axle shafts or wheel hubs, to which it seeks to apply a K2 efficiency factor to account for gearbox losses. But here, the power has arrived via two different paths from the engine, and a third path from the REESS, all of which have experienced different conversion efficiency. The combined power measurement at the axle does not identify the share of power along each path, so there is not enough information to reconstruct the power at R1 and R2REESS even if the conversion efficiency of each path is known.
65. Another option might be to compute (R1+R2REESS) rather than each individually. This would require a "net" K2 factor that accounts for the total losses along all three paths. If all three paths had the same conversion efficiency, it would not be necessary to know the power along  each  path.  But  that  is  not  the  case  here.  While  the  manufacturer  might  be  able  to experimentally determine a "net" K2, it would not be possible to verify using the data that is collected by TP2. If the K2 factor were to represent anything other than this "net" factor, such as for example just the efficiency of the mechanical direct drive path, then it would not be reconstructing the power at either of the designated reference points.
66. This is another way of saying that the original versions of TP1 and TP2, when applied to a power split hybrid, each determine the power at slightly different reference points. When considered individually, either of the results might be reasonable as a system power rating. However, they cannot be expected to be the same if they refer to different reference points.
67. This situation is seen more clearly in Figure 10, for a pure series hybrid. As before, the reference points are where mechanical power is first produced, at R1 and R2REESS. TP1 would determine the mechanical power from the engine (at R1) and the REESS contribution at motor MG (at R2REESS). In contrast, TP2 would measure the power at the axle shafts and apply a K2 factor to account for losses in the gearbox and differential, thereby reaching a different reference point (here called R2TOT) and reporting that as the system power. The power at R2TOT is bound to be different than at (R1 + R2REESS). Further, RTOT is inconsistent as a reference point because it is not a point where mechanical power is first produced.

Figure 10

## Inconsistent reference points for TP1 and TP2 for pure series HEV

1.  Context: The figure is a schematic diagram representing the power flow within a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) powertrain. It illustrates the interaction between an internal combustion engine (ICE), a regenerative electrical energy storage system (REESS), and a motor-generator (MG) unit, focusing on the distribution of power to the wheels.

2.  Deconstruction: The diagram shows the ICE connected to the MG unit via a gearbox (G) and inverters (Inv1, Inv2). The REESS is connected to the MG unit via the inverters. Power flow is indicated by arrows, with red arrows representing power from the ICE, blue arrows representing power from the REESS, and purple arrows representing the combined power delivered to the wheels. The diagram also indicates measurement points (TP1 and TP2) for data acquisition and UNR 85 test results for the ICE. The diagram shows the power split between the ICE and the REESS, with the total power (R2_TOT) being the sum of the ICE power (R1) and the REESS power (R2_REESS).

3.  Implication: The diagram highlights the hybrid powertrain's ability to utilize both the ICE and the REESS for propulsion. The power split between the ICE and REESS can be controlled to optimize fuel efficiency and performance. The measurement points (TP1 and TP2) are critical for validating the powertrain's performance and efficiency. The UNR 85 test results provide a baseline for the ICE's performance. The diagram is useful for understanding the power flow and control strategies within the HEV powertrain.

![Image](ref_artifacts/image_000013_58fae04a1ee2c83648667b6701ce4b4dde6845718dbada0b9ba8ba4e9342f240.png)

Note: measurement point for TP2 represents both axle shafts.

68. Further, as a side effect, here the power measured by TP2 at R2TOT will always be lower than for TP1, because the power at R2TOT has been reduced by losses in the electrical

14

- conversion path (G+Inv2+Inv1+MG), while TP1 considers them to be part of the allowable transmission losses.
69. Even when the reference points are harmonized, some powertrain architectures may pose special challenges to one or the other TP.
70. As shown in Figure 11, TP1 measures power out of the REESS, but does not account for  how  this  power  is  divided  downstream,  between  the  two  parallel  inverter/motors Inv1/MG1 and Inv2/MG2. This means that the K1 factor must account for the combined losses  in  both  inverter/motor  combinations.  Although  the  manufacturer  might  be  able  to experimentally determine and provide such a factor, it could not be independently verified from efficiency data without measuring the individual power flows.
71. Rather than measuring the REESS power, it would be more effective to measure the power into each inverter, and apply a separate K1 factor for each inverter/motor combination. In  this  case  each  K1  factor  could  be  independently  verified  because  the  power  flows are known.
72. In contrast, TP2 does not have a difficulty determining the sum (R1+R2) from the measured power at the axle, given an accurate K2 factor.

Figure 11 Parallel P2 hybrid with two motors, more difficult for TP1

1.  Context: The figure is a schematic diagram representing the powertrain architecture of a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). It illustrates the flow of power between the energy storage system, internal combustion engine, electric motors, and the vehicle's wheels. The primary objective is to depict the mechanical and electrical connections within the powertrain, enabling analysis of power distribution and control strategies.

2.  Deconstruction: The diagram includes a Rechargeable Energy Storage System (REESS) connected to two inverters (Inv1, Inv2), each driving a motor-generator (MG1, MG2). The Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) is mechanically linked to the drivetrain. The outputs of the ICE and the motor-generators (K1) are connected via a transmission (K2) to the wheels. R1 and R2 represent mechanical connections or gear ratios between the ICE, motor-generators, and transmission. TP1 and TP2 indicate measurement points for system performance analysis. The ICE block also indicates UNR 85 test results.

3.  Implication: The diagram highlights a parallel hybrid architecture where both the ICE and electric motors can independently or jointly power the vehicle. The presence of two motor-generators suggests potential for torque vectoring or redundancy. The measurement points (TP1, TP2) are critical for validating system performance and efficiency. The UNR 85 test results indicate that the ICE has been tested according to the UNR 85 standard, which is relevant for emissions and fuel consumption. The gear ratios R1 and R2 are critical parameters for optimizing the powertrain's efficiency and performance across different operating conditions.

Note: measurement point for TP2 represents both axle shafts.

73. Figure 12 shows an example HEV with two powered axles. Here a four-wheel-drive dynamometer  would  be  needed,  and  the  power  measured  at  each  axle  separately.  The reference points on the first (right) axle are marked R1 and R2, and on the second (left) axle, R3. TP2 is straightforward for each axle (although it does require a unique K2 factor for each axle). TP1 can determine R1, R2, and R3 if the electrical measurement points include the inputs to each inverter (Inv1 and Inv2) and factors K1(1) and K1(2) are provided. Alternatively, TP1 can determine R1 and the sum (R2+R3) if the electrical measurement is at the REESS and the conversion efficiency of the two electrical paths can be combined or are the same.

Figure 12

## Vehicle with two powered axles

1.  Context: The figure is a schematic diagram representing the powertrain architecture of a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). It illustrates the flow of mechanical power and the interconnection of key components, including the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE), Rechargeable Energy Storage System (REESS), Motor Generators (MG1, MG2), inverters (Inv1, Inv2), and drivetrain components. The diagram aims to depict the power transmission path and component arrangement for analysis and design purposes.
2.  Deconstruction: The diagram shows the ICE connected to the drivetrain via a reduction gear K2(1) and a differential. MG1 and MG2 are connected to the drivetrain via inverters (Inv1, Inv2), reduction gears K1(1) and K1(2), and a differential. The REESS is connected to the inverters. The diagram also indicates measurement points (TP1 and TP2) for data acquisition and validation. The ICE has an associated tachometer measuring rev/min. The points R1, R2, and R3 indicate locations where the power flow is split or combined.
3.  Implication: The diagram provides a high-level overview of the HEV powertrain, enabling engineers to understand the power flow and component interactions. It highlights the integration of the ICE and electric motors, allowing for analysis of different operating modes (e.g., electric-only, hybrid). The measurement points are critical for validating simulation models and assessing system performance. The gear ratios K1 and K2 are critical design parameters that determine the torque and speed characteristics of the powertrain.

![Image](ref_artifacts/image_000015_3053ecebdc49967e1debc0326d1c088fe7a7a87dd6a703db972ce80754c79928.png)

Note: measurement points for TP2 represent both axle shafts.

74. However, as shown in Figure 13, a small change to the configuration makes it very difficult to apply TP2. Here MG2 might represent a pair of wheel hub motor(s) which now contribute to powering the first axle. The power flow from the wheel hub motors at R3 is likely to experience a very high efficiency K2(2), while those entering the gearbox/differential from (R1+R2) experience a probably lower efficiency K2(1). Because TP2 measures only the combined power, at the axle, it is not possible to apply both K factors to the portion they represent.
75. The applicability of TP1 and TP2 can depend not only on the physical configuration of the powertrain, but also on the selected driving mode. Figure 14 and Figure 15 show two high-power modes of the Generation 2 Chevy Volt powertrain, one for a pure electric chargedepleting (CD) mode and another for a blended charge-sustaining (CS) mode.
76. In  CD  mode  (Figure  14),  both  TP1  and  TP2  can  be  performed  (with  certain assumptions). TP1 can determine both R1 and R2, assuming that the power into each inverter is measured, or the sum (R1+R2) if power from the REESS is measured and the conversion efficiency of both electrical conversion paths is the same and can thus be combined. TP2 can determine  the  sum  (R1+R2)  from  the  power  measured  at  the  axle,  assuming  that  the efficiency of each sun-to-planet (S, P) gear path is the same.

Figure 13 Configuration with difficulty for TP2

1.  Context: The figure is a schematic diagram representing the powertrain architecture of a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). It illustrates the flow of power between the energy storage system (REESS), internal combustion engine (ICE), motor generators (MG1, MG2), inverters (Inv1, Inv2), and the vehicle's drivetrain. The primary objective is to depict the mechanical and electrical connections and energy conversion stages within the hybrid system.

2.  Deconstruction: The diagram shows the REESS connected to inverters (Inv1, Inv2), which in turn drive motor generators (MG1, MG2). The ICE is mechanically linked to the drivetrain via a transmission. MG1 is also mechanically linked to the ICE output shaft. MG2 is mechanically linked to the drivetrain. The diagram indicates measurement points (TP1, TP2) for data acquisition. The ICE has an associated tachometer (rev/min) and UNR 85 test results.

3.  Implication: The diagram highlights a parallel hybrid architecture where both the ICE and electric motors can independently or jointly power the vehicle. The presence of two motor generators (MG1, MG2) suggests potential for regenerative braking and electric-only driving modes. The measurement points (TP1, TP2) are critical for validating system performance and efficiency during testing. The UNR 85 test results indicate compliance with emissions and performance standards. The mechanical linkages (R1, R2, R3) and gear ratios (K1, K2) are critical design parameters for optimizing torque delivery and fuel efficiency.

Figure 14

## Volt Gen 2 charge-depleting Mode 2 (CD2)

Here's a technical summary of the figure:

The figure is a schematic diagram illustrating the powertrain architecture of a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). It depicts the flow of power from energy sources to the vehicle's wheels. The system comprises a Rechargeable Energy Storage System (REESS), an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE), two inverters (Inv1, Inv2), two motor-generators (MG1, MG2), and a transmission with two planetary gear sets. The REESS provides power to MG1 and MG2 via Inv1 and Inv2, respectively. The ICE is shown as disconnected from the transmission. The planetary gear sets, labeled R1 and R2, combine the torque from MG1 and MG2 to drive the wheels. The blue arrows indicate the direction of power flow. The diagram highlights the parallel hybrid configuration, where both electric motors and the ICE (when connected) can independently or jointly power the vehicle. The design implication is that the system allows for electric-only driving, ICE-only driving (if connected), or a combination of both, enabling optimized fuel efficiency and performance.

77. However, in CS mode (Figure 15), the power flow paths are different. TP1 can still determine  R1  and  R2  from  engine  and  REESS  measurements.  But  in  order  for  TP2  to determine the sum (R1+R2) as before, the efficiency of the Ring-to-planet and Sun-to-planet gear paths must be similar enough to be combined. Otherwise, the relative power contributed by the engine and the motor would be required, and it is not collected.

Figure 15

## Volt Gen 2 charge sustaining mode 2 (CS2)

1.  Context: The figure is a schematic diagram illustrating the power flow architecture of a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) powertrain. It aims to depict the mechanical and electrical power transmission paths between the energy sources (ICE and REESS), motor generators (MG1 and MG2), and the final drive.

2.  Deconstruction: The diagram shows an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) and a Rechargeable Energy Storage System (REESS) as primary energy sources. The ICE is mechanically coupled to the transmission via a reduction R1. The REESS is electrically connected to two motor generators (MG1 and MG2) through inverters (Inv1 and Inv2). MG1 is mechanically coupled to the transmission via a reduction R2. The transmission appears to be a planetary gear system, with power from the ICE and MG1 being combined. MG2 is connected to the transmission, but the connection is marked with an "X", indicating it is not always engaged. The combined power is then transmitted to the wheels.

3.  Implication: The diagram highlights a power-split HEV architecture where the ICE and MG1 can independently or jointly drive the wheels. The presence of MG2, with its disengageable connection, suggests a potential for series hybrid operation or regenerative braking. The gear ratios R1 and R2 are critical design parameters for optimizing the operating points of the ICE and MG1, respectively, to maximize efficiency and performance. The "X" connection of MG2 implies a control strategy that dynamically engages/disengages MG2 based on driving conditions.

78. At  the  30th  IWG  on  EVE  meeting,  the  IWG  requested  that  experts  from  VDA (German Association of the Automotive Industry) who were involved with development of the ISO procedure provide additional input on the observed differences between the results of TP1 and TP2. VDA delivered a presentation at the 31 st  IWG on EVE addressing this topic and provided recommendations for the second phase of validation testing.
79. The VDA experts acknowledged that some of the deviation could be the result of fixed,  default  K1  and  K2  factors,  but  felt  that  it  was  also  important  to  verify  that  the measurement requirements and accuracies described in ISO 20762 are followed.
80. VDA also stated that TP1 and TP2 can be expected to give the same result for parallel hybrids, which is consistent with the discussion in the previous paragraphs.
81. For pure series or mixed (power split) hybrids, VDA stated that TP1 will always give a higher result than TP2 because TP1 does not account for electrical conversion losses in the series portion. This observation has now been explained by the difference in the reference points implied by TP1 and TP2 for power split and pure series hybrids, as discussed in the previous paragraphs. Defining the reference points as depicted in  Figure 9 addresses this concern, and means that TP2 becomes not applicable to this powertrain.

## 7. Reconciling TP1 and TP2

82. The IWG on EVE recognized that the need to reconcile TP1 and TP2 was a significant outstanding issue for the completion of the GTR. At the 30th meeting of the IWG on EVE in Stockholm, the IWG considered several options for completing the GTR.

83. One  possibility  was  to  accept  the  difference  between  TP1  and  TP2,  and  add interpretive text to the GTR to help users understand the difference. This would maintain the flexibility of the procedure, minimize divergence from ISO 20762, and reduce the likelihood that the difference could be misunderstood or deliberately misused. This option found little support.
84. Another possibility was to eliminate the difference by modifying the GTR to define only a single possible result, rather than two. This might be done by any of:

(a) Including only TP1 or TP2 in the GTR; (b) Requiring  both  TP1  and  TP2,  and  reporting  the  average,  the  lower,  or  the higher of the two; (c) Retaining  the  nominal  choice  of  TP1  or  TP2,  but  validating  the  result  by performing the other TP as a consistency check; (d) Specifying TP1 for some HEV architectures and TP2 for others. 85. (a) The IWG was reluctant to eliminate either TP1 or TP2 entirely, due in part to the

- flexibility it affords, and preferences among members for one or the other procedure.
86. (b, c) The IWG was reluctant to require both TPs to be performed because this would increase the test burden. Also, it was noted that the best choice among an average, lower, or higher  of  the  two  results  would  depend  on  the  intended  purpose  of  the  measure.  For downscaling and classification under WLTP, selecting the higher figure might be preferable because it would prevent excessive downscaling. But for customer information, the lower figure might be preferable to prevent exaggerating the available power. It was unclear if there was a valid technical justification for selecting either figure, or an average of the two, when it remained uncertain which result is most accurate for a given vehicle.
87. (d) The IWG remained open to the possibility of assigning TP1 and TP2 to specific powertrain types, given a clear technical justification.
88. A final possibility was to modify the procedure to minimize the difference between TP1 and TP2 as much as possible.
89. Because the problem is essentially one of physics, it should be possible to define TP1 and TP2 so that they deliver comparable results in all cases, if the following is true: (a) the power flows in the vehicle are correctly understood, (b) the reference points are correctly identified and consistent under both TP1 and TP2, and (c) the measurements and K factors are sufficiently accurate to estimate the power at the reference points.
90. The question is to what degree the procedures for TP1 and TP2 can provide for this outcome while remaining practical to implement. For example, if successfully applying TP1 sometimes requires instrumentation of several inverter inputs rather than only the REESS output, or if successfully applying TP2 requires knowledge of relative power flows that are not measurable at the axle, the instrumentation burden may become prohibitive.
91. At the 30th and 31 st  IWG on EVE meetings it was generally agreed that the difference between TP1 and TP2 should be reduced as much as possible by modifying the procedures, and  that  limiting  certain  architectures  to  TP1  or  TP2  could  also  be  considered.  Several proposed  modifications  were  identified  to  be  evaluated  in  a  second  phase  of  validation testing.
8. Modifications to the procedure
92. The  IWG  reached  consensus  on  several  proposed  modifications  to  reduce  the difference between TP1 and TP2:

(a) The option to use default K factors was replaced with a requirement that the manufacturer provide accurate and verifiable K factors specific to the vehicle under test. (b) The  option  to  conduct  TP2  using  chassis  dynamometer  roller  data  was removed,  in  favor  of  axle  or  wheel  hub  instrumentation  for  torque  and  speed,  or  a  hub dynamometer.

17

ECE/TRANS/180/Add.21

(c) The procedure was clarified to require that current and voltage, if obtained from onboard systems, must be shown to be accurate (TP1).

93. The drafting group also proposed several changes to be trialed in the second validation phase:

(a) To reduce the possibility of variation, five repetitions of the power test are conducted and an average taken of the last four results (see paragraph 6.8.7.). (b) Applicability guidelines were added to determine the permissible application of TP1 and TP2 based on aspects of the power flows between the measurement points and the reference points, and any need for additional instrumentation to enable one or the other TP (see paragraph 6.1.3.). (c) A  requirement  was  added  for  the  manufacturer  to  document  the  flow  of propulsion  power  through  the  powertrain  of  the  vehicle  during  the  maximum  power condition, the proposed measurement points and reference points, and applicable K factors for TP1 or TP2 (see paragraph 6.1.1.1.). (d) The  term  "reference  point"  was  introduced  and  defined.  Guidelines  for identifying reference points are provided in Annex 1.

94. The new requirement that K factors be furnished by the manufacturer means that it must be possible for the manufacturer to determine the relevant K factor, and for a third party to verify it by a standard method.
95. The IWG considered that for TP1, test standards exist for the measurement of inverter and motor efficiency (K1), which could be used by the manufacturer to derive the K1 factor as well as by a third party to verify it. However, no similar test standard exists for gearbox efficiency (K2).
96. VDA was asked to provide a recommendation for a standard method for determining K2 for TP2. VDA recommended that any of various engineering methods could be employed, based on measurement of power in and power out on a test bench, and dividing output power by input power.
97. The IWG also considered a proposal that a K2 factor might be determined (or verified) by performing TP1 using a known accurate K1 factor, and then solving for K2 by setting the result of TP1 equal to the result of TP2. A similar tactic might also be usable for internal validation of a test result. This approach was to be further evaluated with data from the second phase of validation.
9. Second phase of validation testing
98. The test laboratories were requested to implement a second phase of validation testing, with the following changes to the test program:

(a) Conduct TP2 with torque and speed data from torque and speed sensors rather than dynamometer roller data. (b) Conduct TP1 with current and voltage data collected from current and voltage instrumentation, in addition to onboard data. (c) If more than one electrical power path is present downstream of the battery, then instrument the inputs to each inverter (if possible). (d) Seek measurements of electrical power to non-propulsion accessories. (e) Improve precision of wheel speed and dynamometer roller speed to identify presence of wheel slippage. (f) If significant wheel slippage is observed, add weight to the vehicle to eliminate it, particularly if slippage might affect the shifting or other behavior of the vehicle.

99. In most cases, K factors were not expected to be available. Outside of a type approval or certification context, manufacturers are unlikely to have suitable data already prepared and little incentive to produce it. Even if K factors were provided, their usefulness in validating the procedure would be limited unless they could be independently verified (which was not

18

- within the scope of the program). Instead, the results were to be evaluated by considering the ability for reasonable K factors to make the results of each TP consistent with each other.
100. For the second phase of validation, ECCC tested: a 2018 BMW 530e (OVC-HEV), a 2016 Chevrolet  Volt  (OVC-HEV),  a  2018  Toyota  Prius Prime  (OVC-HEV),  and  a  2009 Saturn Vue (mild BAS NOVC-HEV). JRC expressed an intention of testing two additional vehicles, and as of Autumn 2019 were continuing efforts to procure suitable vehicles and provide them with necessary instrumentation. US EPA had intended to test two additional vehicles, but damage to one of the vehicles, and an unexpected difficulty with the funding mechanism for contract work necessary to instrument the vehicles, made it impossible for EPA to participate in the second phase.
101. Results of the second phase began to become available in late 2019 and continued to be  produced  through  March  2020.  At  an  interim  IWG  on  EVE  teleconference  on  12 December 2019, ECCC provided draft reports for the 2018 BMW 530e and the 2016 Chevy Volt, followed by final reports in March 2020. A report for the Saturn Vue was delivered in February 2020. As of March 2020 a draft report for the Prius Prime is awaiting completion.
102. JRC provided test results for hub dyno testing and is progressing to provide results of wheel torque measurements on the same vehicle.
103. Throughout the test program, ECCC encountered difficulty obtaining UN Regulation No. 85 engine test results applicable to the vehicles tested. UN Regulation No. 85 results were obtained for the Toyota Prius Prime in January 2020, and for the European version of the BMW 530e in February 2020 (however, the vehicle tested was a North America vehicle for which the engine has a different torque specification). Because the Chevy Volt and the Saturn Vue are not EU-spec vehicles, UN Regulation No85 data was not available for these vehicles. For these reasons,  TP1 could not be performed for these in exactly the manner prescribed.
104. As for TP2 results, ECCC found that the torque and speed measurement devices gave inconsistent results and in some cases malfunctioned. There is significant doubt as to whether the TP2 results are valid due to these difficulties.
105. Although a direct comparison between TP1 and TP2 was therefore not possible in many cases, the second phase of validation revealed valuable recommendations regarding the practicability of the procedure and recommendations for improvement.
106. Additionally, late results from JRC testing with a hub dynamometer have confirmed good agreement between TP1 and TP2 for a P2 hybrid configuration. Analysis of the data will continue to further validate this conclusion and for consideration in the development of future versions of this GTR.
- C. Technical rationale and justification

Section C.1 describes the technical justification for the major specific differences between the procedure described in this GTR and the ISO 20762 procedure on which it was based.

Section  C.2  provides  additional  discussion  of  the  basis  upon  which  the  IWG  on  EVE recommends the procedure as a whole.

1. Primary differences between ISO 20762 and this GTR

## (a) Some measurement accuracies aligned with UN GTR No. 15

107. A primary anticipated use for the test procedure is for determining a system power for the  purpose of classification and downscaling under the WLTP test procedure defined in UN GTR No. 15. In a few cases where requirements stated under ISO 20762 varied from UN GTR No. 15 they were aligned with UN GTR No. 15, as can be seen in paragraph 5.2. of this GTR and summarized in Table 1 below.

19

ECE/TRANS/180/Add.21

## Table 1 Differences in required measurement accuracies

1.  Objective: The table presents a comparison of measurement tolerances for various parameters as defined by the ISO 20762 standard and the UN GTR No. 15 regulation.
2.  Layout: The table is organized with the first column listing the "Measurement item," including electrical voltage, electrical current, room temperature, and dynamometer speed. Subsequent columns provide the corresponding measurement tolerances specified by the ISO 20762 standard and the UN GTR No. 15 regulation. The tolerances are expressed in units appropriate for each measurement item, such as percentage, degrees Celsius, or kilometers per hour.
3.  Significance: This table serves as a quick reference for comparing the stringency of measurement requirements between the two standards. It is useful for engineers, technicians, and regulatory personnel to ensure compliance with the appropriate standard during testing and validation processes. The table facilitates informed decision-making regarding measurement equipment selection and data interpretation based on the applicable regulatory framework.

| Measurement item   | ISO 20762                               | UN GTR No. 15 and this GTR   |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Electrical voltage | ±0.5%                                   | ±0.3 %FSD or ±1 %of reading  |
| Electrical current | ±0.5%                                   | ±0.3 %FSD or ±1 %of reading  |
| Room temperature   | ±2 °C                                   | ±1 °C                        |
| Dynamometer speed  | ±0.5 km/h or ±1 %, whichever is greater | ±0.2 km/h                    |

## (b) Manufacturer to provide verifiable K factor(s)

108. ISO 20762 allows for K factors to be provided by the manufacturer. It also provides default K factors that could be used as needed. The IWG on EVE noted that no fixed default K factor could be expected to be equally accurate for all vehicles, and so the use of default factors could contribute to variation between TP1 and TP2.
109. Unlike ISO 20762, this GTR is likely to be applied in the context of type approval or certification. In this context, it is likely that there will be sufficient manufacturer cooperation to prevent the need to assume a default K factor.
110. This GTR therefore requires the manufacturer to provide verifiable K factor(s) in all cases, as described at paragraph 6.1.1.2. Determination and verification of the provided K factor(s) can be performed through applicable test standards or other methods as described in paragraph 6.1.1.2.

## (c) TP2 to utilize torque and speed sensors or hub dynamometer

111. ISO 20762 specified that measurement of torque and speed for TP2 may be acquired by  use  of  torque  and  speed  sensors  attached  to  the  axle  shafts  or  wheel  hubs,  or  by dynamometer measurements of speed and torque delivered to the dynamometer rollers. In the latter case, losses in the tires are to be accounted for. A specific method for determining the losses is not provided.
112. The IWG found that accounting for tire losses may introduce uncertainties specific to TP2. Accounting for rolling resistance requires that the rolling resistance coefficient (RRC) and  the  normal  force  on  the  tires  both  be  known.  RRC  is  not  always  known  with  high accuracy. When installed on a dynamometer, the normal force may be uncertain due to the effect of the tie down method (usually tensioned straps or chains, or rigid restraints). Tire slippage under maximum power may be difficult to eliminate, and can add losses that are difficult to quantify.
113. The  GTR therefore  removes  the  option  for  dynamometer  roller  measurements  for TP2, and adds a new option to use a hub dynamometer on each powered axle as described at paragraph 6.1.2.2. of this GTR.

## (d) TP1 to include measurement of fuel flow rate

114. ISO  20762  required  measurement  of  intake  manifold  pressure  for  verification  of engine power by reference to ISO 1585 test conditions. Measurement of fuel flow rate is only required if the confirmation of air fuel ratio according to ISO 1585 is necessary.
115. Experts in the IWG indicated that intake manifold pressure may be insufficient to verify ISO 1585 test conditions especially considering variable atmospheric conditions. Fuel flow rate provides a more precise and additional check.
116. The  GTR  therefore  requires  collection  of  fuel  flow  rate  for  TP1  in  all  cases.  To minimize burden, fuel flow rate may be collected from on-board data if its accuracy is shown to the responsible authority.

20

- (e) TP1 recommended to measure power input at each inverter if REESS powers multiple inverters
117. ISO 20762 specified that TP1 be performed with measurement of current and voltage at the REESS.
118. The IWG found that this may introduce uncertainties specific to TP1, for electrified powertrains in which the current from the REESS is subsequently routed to more than one propulsion energy converter (i.e. more than one inverter/motor combination) that are deemed likely to experience significantly different electrical conversion efficiencies.
119. For  powertrains  where  the  REESS  current  is  routed  to  more  than  one  propulsion energy converter, this GTR recommends that the input to each inverter be instrumented in addition  to  the  REESS  output,  unless  it  is  possible  to  determine  net  efficiency  of  the combination, or the efficiencies are the same, as described in paragraph 6.1.3.1. of this GTR. Use of on-board data may be another alternative as allowed in paragraph 6.1.2.
- (f) Repetition and averaging
120. ISO 20762 does not include a requirement for repetition or averaging of multiple tests. In validation testing,  some  variation  was  observed  between  sequential  tests.  Korea recommended  performing  several  tests  and  disregarding  the  first  test  result.  Subsequent testing confirmed that this practice reduces the variation. The GTR now specifies that five repetitions be conducted and the result be based on an average of the last four repetitions.
121. The GTR also places a limit on the variability of the four averaged measurements, at within ±5 percent of the mean. The variation must be recorded and if it is exceeded, the tests should be performed again, and if the variation cannot be reduced, the result is subject to approval by the responsible authority.
- (g) Establishment of the "reference point" concept to assure comparable and equivalent results for various HEV architectures
122. The  IWG  found  that  the  clear  identification  of  reference  points  for  various  HEV architectures, and the use of the same reference points for both TP1 and TP2, are important to the expectation that TP1 and TP2 should both deliver a highly similar result. This GTR establishes reference points for common HEV architectures (see Annex 1 of this GTR) and provides  a  clear  definition  of  "reference  point"  (see  paragraph  3.5.)  to  assist  with  the identification of valid reference points for other architectures.

## (h) Applicability of TP1 or TP2 determined by power flows

123. ISO 20762 did not limit application of TP1 or TP2 to specific powertrain types.
124. The  IWG  found  that  the  specific  flow  of  power  through  different  electrified powertrain architectures can pose uncertainties for the equitable application of TP1 or TP2 using the specified reference points and measurement points.
125. The GTR therefore includes a set of applicability rules to determine the applicability of TP1 and TP2 based on characteristics of power flow through the powertrain as described in paragraph 6.1.3. of this GTR.
4. (i) Manufacturer to provide hybrid power flow description
126. The IWG found that some electrified powertrains support complex power flows. The specific flow of power that takes place under the maximum power condition is not always clear. This GTR adds a specific requirement for the manufacturer to provide a hybrid power flow description as described in paragraph 6.1.1.1. of this GTR. The description shall also specify  recommended  measurement  points,  reference  points,  and  K  factor(s),  where applicable. The description is intended to provide the authority with concrete information that may be used to determine the applicability of TP1 and TP2 and to assist the authority or third parties with validation and verification.

21

ECE/TRANS/180/Add.21

- (j) All-wheel drive vehicles to account for each axle independently
127. ISO 20762 did not distinguish between differently powered axles. The GTR adds a specific  provision  that  if  a  vehicle  has  two  powered  axles,  each  axle  shall  be  tested independently and simultaneously on a 4wd chassis dynamometer or two hub dynamometers, and each may apply a different TP if desired (see text at paragraph 6.1.).

## (k) Addition of internal validation criteria

128. This GTR introduces a simple mathematical test to reject a result that is inconsistent with  the  effect  of  losses  in  the  drivetrain  (see  paragraph  6.10.).  An  implied  drivetrain efficiency is computed by dividing the power measured at the dynamometer by the sustained power result. Due to drivetrain losses, the quotient should be less than 1. The addition of this validation step results in a new requirement to collect the power delivered by the vehicle to the dynamometer as described at the end of paragraph 6.1.2.
2. (l) New terms defined
129. Definitions  have  been  added  for  several  new  terms  related  to  system  power determination (see paragraph 3.5.).

## (m) Clarification of gear shifting

130. ISO 20762 did not address the possibility of automatic gear shifting that might occur during the 10-second window of the power test, or the permissibility of manual gear shifting if the gearbox is ordinarily automatically shifted. Text has been added in paragraphs 6.8.6. and 6.9.1. to clarify these issues.

## (n) Permissibility of validated onboard data for all measurements

131. UN GTR No. 15 allows for the use of on-board data in place of REESS measurements for  current  and  voltage,  if  the  accuracy  of  the  data  is  demonstrated  to  the  responsible authority. It  was noted that such a provision in this GTR  could provide an alternative to potentially  difficult  or  impractical  instrumentation  of  inverter  inputs  or  other  electrical components under TP1. It was also noted that the added requirement to physically measure the fuel flow rate could be burdensome, and that the use of validated on-board data could also reduce the instrumentation burden for other parameters needed for the power calculation. Text was therefore added in paragraph 6.1.2. of this GTR to generally allow use of on-board data when available, subject to demonstration to the responsible authority that the use of this data meets the accuracy and frequency requirements under paragraph 5.2.
2. (o) Updated equations for calculating system power
132. The equations for calculating system power rating under TP1 and TP2 in paragraph 6.9. have been revised to clarify that the system power rating is the summation of the power calculated  at  all  of  the  reference  points  that  are  applicable  to  the  vehicle  powertrain architecture.
2. Recommendation of procedure
133. Both  the  first  and  second  phases  of  the  validation  program  provided  a  wealth  of information  relating  to  the  practicability  and  effectiveness  of  the  draft  procedure.  The opportunity to implement the evolving procedure at several laboratories helped to identify ambiguities in the procedure, as well as evaluate the procedure for the ability to produce an effective characterization of system power in a reliable manner.
134. The differences between the results of TP1 and TP2 that were encountered in the first phase of validation also led to a careful examination of the nature of the problem that the procedure seeks to solve, and the theoretical and physical requirements for a valid solution. This led to the development of the reference point concept, which, when integrated with the procedure, provided (a) a clear technical basis for judging the applicability of TP1 or TP2 to various powertrain architectures, and (b) a strong theoretical basis for the expectation that TP1 and TP2 should yield similar results for powertrains to which both are applicable.

22

135. Ideally, validation of the procedure would be founded on strong evidence that TP1 and TP2 deliver closely similar results. The latest JRC results from the hub dynamometer tests confirmed a good agreement for a P2 parallel hybrid. However, the validation program was  able  to  produce  only  limited  additional  data  that  would  allow  a  direct  comparison between the results of TP1 and TP2 for the same vehicle.
136. One reason is that for some of the powertrain architectures, either TP1 or TP2 is no longer applicable under the revised procedure. These vehicles cannot provide a comparison between TP1 and TP2 because only one is applicable.
137. Another reason is that it was not possible to authentically reproduce all of the aspects of a type approval situation in the validation program. In some cases this limited the ability to perform both TP1 and TP2 in the prescribed manner. For example, in a type approval situation, the manufacturer would have prepared in advance all of the information that is now required for conducting the revised procedure, often relying on proprietary information that was not available to the validation program. This information, such as K factors for TP1 or TP2, hybrid power flow descriptions, and in some cases UN Regulation No. 85 engine test data, were not available, partly because some were new requirements that did not allow the necessary  lead  time,  and  partly  because  of  limited  motivation  for  manufacturers  of  the selected vehicles to provide this proprietary information.
138. Aside from limited opportunity to directly compare TP1 and TP2, there are several persuasive reasons to have good confidence in the ability of the revised procedure to deliver valid results.
139. In the revised procedure, it is now assured that both TP1 and TP2 measure power at the same reference points. This eliminates a cause of some previously identified differences, which were related to the implicit use of sometimes inconsistent reference points in the earlier version of the procedure.
140. The revised procedure also makes it clear whether or not a given TP is applicable to a  given  vehicle,  preventing  the  possibility  of  applying  a  TP  for  which  the  powertrain architecture cannot support its use, and leading to the delivery of only a single result.
141. Additionally, the validation program provided additional evidence that the maximum power of the vehicles tested can be reliably commanded by the fixed-speed dynamometer method.
142. The  primary  remaining  potential  source  of  error  between  the  two  TPs  would  be measurement  error.  Requirements  for  measurement  accuracy  and  frequency  are  clearly identified in the procedure, and align with similar requirements in ISO 20762 and UN GTR No.  15.  If  the  type  approval  authority  conducts  the  procedure  with  care,  the  remaining potential for error should be small.
3. Future development of the GTR
143. At this time, this GTR specifies a reference method but not a candidate method. A candidate method, which would not require dynamometer testing but instead would be based on  the  results  of  component  tests,  would  potentially  allow  a  vehicle  power  rating  to  be determined at a lower expense. Future development and validation of a candidate method remains a possibility for future work.
- D. Technical feasibility, anticipated costs and benefits
144. The specification of a test procedure for power determination will remove significant uncertainty  that  manufacturers  now  face  in  communicating  the  power  level  of  electrified vehicles both to the public and to regulating authorities, and resolves the question of how to determine a system power rating for electrified vehicles for use with WLTP.
145. Initially the adoption of the procedure may bear some costs for vehicle manufacturers, technical  services  and  authorities,  at  least  considered  on  a  local  scale,  since  some  test equipment and procedures may have to be upgraded. However, these costs should be limited since such upgrades are done regularly as adaptations to technical progress. Related costs

23

ECE/TRANS/180/Add.21

- would  have  to  be  quantified  on  a  regional  level  since  they  largely  depend  on  the  local conditions.

24

## II. Text of the GTR

1. Purpose

This Global Technical Regulation (UN GTR)  provides a worldwide harmonized method to determine a system power rating for electrified lightduty  vehicles  that  is  comparable  to  traditional  measures  of  system  power applicable to conventional vehicles.

- 5.2.2. Measurement frequency

All the items in Table 2 of 5.2.1, unless specified otherwise in the table, shall be measured and recorded at a frequency equal to or greater than 10 Hz.

The  items  atmospheric  pressure  and  room  temperature  shall  be  at  least recorded as single measurement activity at start of vehicle operation (see 6.8.5) and after end of vehicle running (see 6.8.8).

## 6. Test procedure

- 6.1. General

The following test procedures determine a vehicle system power rating for a hybrid  electric  vehicle,  or  for  a  pure  electric  vehicle  with  more  than  one propulsion energy converter.

Two test procedures are described herein.

Test procedure 1 (TP1) is based on measured electrical power, estimated ICE power, and estimated electrical conversion efficiency.

Test procedure 2 (TP2) is based on measured torque and speed at the drive shaft(s) or wheel hub(s) and estimated mechanical conversion efficiency.

TP1 and TP2 are intended to be technically equivalent methods for determining a vehicle system power rating from available measurements. TP1 and TP2 are distinguished by the specific instrumentation, measurements, other inputs, and calculations necessary to determine the vehicle system power rating.

Each  powered  axle  that  provides  propulsion  under  the  maximum  power condition  shall  be  tested  by  chassis  dynamometer  or  hub  dynamometer. Vehicles that are powered by two powered axles under the maximum power condition shall be tested by four-wheel-drive chassis dynamometer, or each powered axle shall be tested simultaneously by hub dynamometer.

- 6.1.1. Required information

The manufacturer shall provide the following information required to conduct either test procedure.

- 6.1.1.1. Hybrid power flow description

The manufacturer shall provide a hybrid power flow description sufficient to identify the energy flow paths and energy conversions by which propulsion is produced  during  the  maximum  power  condition,  beginning  at  each  of  the propulsion energy storage systems and proceeding to each powered axle. The description  shall  also  indicate  each  non-propulsion  auxiliary  and  peripheral device that is powered by the REESS under this condition, including DC/DC converter and high-voltage auxiliaries or peripherals.

The description shall also indicate the power determination reference points applicable to the vehicle (according to the guidelines in Annex 1 of this GTR), the measurement points according to TP1 or TP2, and the components to which applicable energy conversion factors (K factors) apply.

- 6.1.1.2. Energy conversion factors (K factors)

Where TP1 is to be performed, the manufacturer shall provide the electrical energy conversion efficiency (K1) between each electrical measurement point and  corresponding  reference point,  applicable  to  the  maximum  power condition. In general, K1 factors represent output power of an electric machine (or  a  combination  of  electric  machines  where  applicable)  divided  by  input power to the inverter that powers the electric machine(s).

30

In determining or verifying a K1 factor, the electrical conversion efficiency of the inverter and electric machine or their combinations shall be determined by an applicable test standard such as ISO 21782, SAE J2907, or equivalent. The provided value is subject to verification by the responsible authority.

Where  TP2  is  to  be  performed,  the  manufacturer  shall  provide,  for  each powered axle, the mechanical energy conversion efficiency (K2) between each axle  or  wheel  hub  power  measurement  point  and  corresponding  reference point(s), applicable to the maximum power condition.  In general, K2 factors represent mechanical power output to the axle shafts or wheel hubs divided by mechanical power input to a gearbox or set of similar mechanical components by which the mechanical power is conducted from the applicable reference point(s).

In determining or verifying a K2 factor, the mechanical conversion efficiency of drivetrain components or their combinations shall be determined by dividing the measured output power by the measured input power. The provided value is subject to verification by the responsible authority.

- 6.1.1.3. Speed of maximum power

The speed of maximum power (as defined in 3.5) shall be determined by the procedure  specified  in  Annex  2,  either  by  the  manufacturer  or  by  the responsible authority.

- 6.1.1.4. Other information

The manufacturer shall specify the normal operating range for each operational metric listed in 6.8.1.

Regarding any dynamometer operation mode (see 6.7), the manufacture shall provide a list of the deactivated devices and justification for the deactivation.

- 6.1.2. Required measurements

The test vehicle shall be instrumented with measurement devices for measuring the necessary input values for the power calculation.

As an alternative to use of measurement devices, use of on-board measurement data is permissible if the accuracy and frequency of these data is demonstrated to the responsible authority to meet the minimum requirements for accuracy and frequency described in 5.2.

Measurements  common  to  both  TP1  and  TP2  include  accelerator  pedal command,  atmospheric  pressure,  room  temperature,  and  the  operational metrics listed in 6.8.1.

For the purpose of internal validation (see 6.10.), the power delivered by the vehicle  to  the  dynamometer during  the  maximum power condition shall be recorded (for example, by recording dynamometer wheel speed and torque, or dynamometer power if available, at a minimum of 10 Hz).

- 6.1.2.1. Measurements specific to TP1

For  TP1,  the  following  measurements  are  additionally  required:  electrical current and voltage at the REESS or inverter inputs (as specified according to 6.1.3.1.), and ICE speed, intake manifold pressure, and fuel flow rate (if the hybrid power flow description indicates that an ICE contributes propulsion power during the maximum power condition). In this case, TP1 also requires an applicable full load power curve for the ICE, and in some cases may require conducting ISO 1585:1992 or UN Regulation No. 85 (as described in 6.9.2.1.).

If a DC/DC converter is powered by the REESS for the purpose of providing power to  the  12-volt  auxiliary  bus,  the  manufacturer  may  elect  to  measure current and voltage at the input to the DC/DC converter in lieu of using the default of 1.0 kW.

If  the  hybrid  power  flow  description  indicates  that  high-voltage  auxiliaries other than the above-mentioned DC/DC converter are powered by the REESS during the maximum power condition, the power consumed shall be measured or estimated (see 6.9.2.2.).

- 6.1.2.2. Measurements specific to TP2

For TP2, the following measurements are additionally required: torque and rotational speed at the powered axle shafts or wheel hubs.

Important: if the ICE power needs to be corrected according to the provisions of 6.9.3.2., the measurement requirements of TP1 with regard to current and voltage may also apply (see 6.9.3.3.).

Wheel torque and rotational speed measurement may be provided either by means  of  a  hub  dynamometer  or  by  means  of  appropriate,  calibrated measurement device(s) for torque and rotational speed of the powered axle shaft(s) or wheel hub(s).

If  a  powered  axle  delivers  power  to  the  wheels  through  a  differential,  it  is sufficient to instrument and collect data from only one of the two drive shafts or wheel hubs. In this case, the measured torque at a drive shaft or wheel hub shall be multiplied by 2 in order to get the total torque per powered axle.

- 6.1.3. Test procedure applicability

Applicability of TP1 and TP2 varies with powertrain architecture, depending on the  ability  for  one  or  the  other  procedure  to  determine  the  power  at  the reference point(s) that are applicable to the powertrain architecture.

The responsible authority shall confirm that the reference points identified in the hybrid power flow description are in accordance with the requirements of Annex 1 and the definition of "power determination reference point" in 3.5.

The responsible authority shall use the following considerations to determine applicability of TP1 and TP2 to the test vehicle. Where both TP1 and TP2 are applicable, the choice may be made by the manufacturer.

When  reported  for  type  approval,  the  vehicle  system  power  rating  that  is determined by use of this GTR shall be identified as having been determined by either TP1 or TP2.

- 6.1.3.1. Applicability of TP1

Applicability  of  TP1  requires  that  the  power  passing  through  all  reference points can be accurately determined by performing the prescribed procedure.

Subject  to  this  requirement,  TP1  is  typically  applicable  if  either  of  the following conditions 6.1.3.1.1. or 6.1.3.1.2. are fulfilled:

- 6.1.3.1.1. The hybrid power flow description indicates that the electrical current from each REESS powers a single electric machine, and current and voltage at the output of each REESS can be determined, and the manufacturer provides an accurate K1 factor representing the electrical conversion efficiency between the input to the inverter and the corresponding reference point.

Figure 16

Example of Case 6.1.3.1.1., TP1 applicable. Power at R [kW] = (U [V] * I [A] / 1000) * K1

1.  Context: The figure is a system block diagram representing the power flow and control architecture of a renewable energy storage system (REESS) connected to an electrical machine (EM) via an inverter (INV). The diagram illustrates the functional relationship between the REESS, inverter, and electrical machine, focusing on power conversion and delivery.
2.  Deconstruction: The REESS block represents the energy storage component, providing voltage (U) and current (I) to the system. The inverter (INV) block converts the DC power from the REESS to AC power suitable for the electrical machine (EM). The EM block represents the electrical machine, which delivers power to the load (R). The dashed box labeled "K1" encapsulates the inverter and electrical machine, indicating a subsystem or module.
3.  Implication: The diagram highlights the critical role of the inverter in interfacing the REESS with the electrical machine. Design considerations must focus on inverter efficiency, power handling capabilities, and control strategies to optimize energy transfer from the REESS to the load. The "K1" subsystem suggests modularity, implying that the inverter and electrical machine can be treated as a single unit for design and integration purposes.

Or,

6.1.3.1.2. At least one of the following conditions (a) to (c) is fulfilled:

- (a) Current and voltage at the input to each inverter that is powered by the REESS  can  be  determined,  and  the  manufacturer  provides  accurate K1(n) factors representing the electrical conversion efficiency between each input and the corresponding reference point(s).

Figure 17

Example of Case 6.1.3.1.2.(a), TP1 applicable.

Power at R1 [kW] = (U1 [V] * I1 [A] / 1000) * K1(1)

Power at R2 [kW] = (U2 [V] * I2 [A] / 1000) * K1(2)

1.  Context: The figure is a single-line diagram representing a power system architecture for renewable energy integration. It illustrates the connection of a Renewable Energy and Energy Storage System (REESS) to two independent loads, R1 and R2, via separate inverter-electromagnetic interference filter stages. The diagram focuses on the power flow and component arrangement.
2.  Deconstruction: The REESS serves as the primary power source. It is connected to two parallel branches, each consisting of an inverter (INV1, INV2) and an electromagnetic interference filter (EM1, EM2). INV1 and INV2 convert the REESS DC output to AC power, supplying loads R1 and R2, respectively. EM1 and EM2 are used to filter the output of the inverters. The diagram also indicates voltage (U) and current (I) at the input of each branch.
3.  Implication: The parallel architecture allows for independent control and operation of the two loads, R1 and R2. The use of separate inverters provides redundancy and allows for different voltage/frequency requirements for each load. The inclusion of EMI filters is critical for ensuring electromagnetic compatibility and compliance with regulatory standards. The design must consider the power ratings of the inverters and EMI filters to meet the load demands and ensure stable operation.

![Image](ref_artifacts/image_000020_7b9b5167f0dcd33049ed2e04bdef3f60ff398bf9fea4806978cabfc112d1d59d.png)

- (b) Current and voltage at the output of the REESS can be determined, and the manufacturer provides an accurate K1comb factor representing the combined electrical conversion efficiency of the inverters and electric machines between the REESS and the corresponding reference point(s).

Figure 18

Example of Case 6.1.3.1.2.(b), TP1 applicable

Power at (R1+R2) [kW] = (U [V] * I [A] / 1000) * K1comb

1.  Context: The figure is a block diagram representing a power conversion system for renewable energy electrical storage systems (REESS). It illustrates the architecture for converting and delivering power from the REESS to two independent loads.
2.  Deconstruction: The diagram shows a REESS connected to a combined unit K1_comb, which contains two parallel branches. Each branch consists of an inverter (INV1, INV2) and an electromagnetic interference (EMI) filter (EM1, EM2). The REESS provides voltage (U) and current (I) to the K1_comb unit. The outputs of each branch, R1 and R2, represent power delivered to independent loads.
3.  Implication: The diagram highlights a design where a single REESS can supply power to two independent loads through parallel inverter-EMI filter combinations. This architecture allows for independent control and isolation of each load, improving system reliability and flexibility. The design must consider the current and voltage requirements of each load, as well as the EMI filtering requirements to ensure compliance with relevant standards.

![Image](ref_artifacts/image_000021_3f8603ce39d0b56cba51cda455f023e7712b34fd777845ef066eb697b55ff34a.png)

- (c) Current and voltage at the output of the REESS can be determined, and the electrical conversion efficiency between the input to each inverter and the corresponding reference point is identical and is thus represented by the same K1 factor.

Figure 19 Example of Case 6.1.3.1.2.(c), TP1 applicable Power at (R1+R2) [kW] = (U [V] * I [A] / 1000) * K1

Here's a technical summary of the figure:

This figure is a system-level block diagram illustrating a redundant power conversion architecture for a Renewable Energy and Energy Storage System (REESS). The REESS provides a DC power source that is split into two parallel conversion paths. Each path, enclosed within a dashed-line box labeled "K1," consists of an inverter (INV1 or INV2) and an electric machine (EM1 or EM2). The inverters convert the DC power from the REESS to AC power suitable for driving the electric machines. The output of each electric machine (R1 and R2) is connected to a load, represented by an asterisk. The diagram indicates that the system is designed with redundancy, where either K1 path can supply power to the load. The input to the REESS is labeled "u,I," representing voltage and current. The key engineering insight is the implementation of parallel, redundant power conversion paths to enhance system reliability. If one inverter or electric machine fails, the other path can continue to supply power, ensuring continuous operation. This design has implications for component sizing, control strategies, and fault detection/isolation mechanisms.

## 6.1.3.2. Applicability of TP2

Applicability  of  TP2  requires  that  the  power  passing  through  all  reference points can be accurately determined by performing the prescribed procedure. Each powered axle is to be evaluated separately. TP2 is applicable only if it is applicable to all powered axles.

Subject to these requirements, TP2 is typically applicable to a powered axle if either of the following conditions 6.1.3.2.1. or 6.1.3.2.2. are fulfilled:

- 6.1.3.2.1. The hybrid power flow description indicates that torque to the axle originates from a single reference point, and the torque from the reference point is routed only  to  that  axle,  and  the  manufacturer  provides  an  accurate  K2  factor representing the mechanical conversion efficiency between the reference point and the measurement point.

Figure 20

Example of Case 6.1.3.2.1., TP2 applicable to axle. Power at R1 [kW] = (2π * τ [Nm] * rps [s-1] / 1000) / K2

Here's a technical summary of the figure:

1.  Context: The figure is a simplified schematic representing a drivetrain system, likely for a vehicle. Its primary objective is to illustrate the flow of power and torque through the system's key components.
2.  Deconstruction: The diagram shows an input force R1 being applied to a component K2, which is likely a transmission or gearbox. K2 outputs a force to a differential, which then distributes power to the wheels. The variable τ represents torque, measured in unspecified units, and rps represents rotations per second, indicating the rotational speed of the wheels. The arrows indicate the direction of power flow.
3.  Implication: The figure highlights the fundamental relationship between input force, gear reduction (represented by K2), and the resulting torque and rotational speed at the wheels. This is critical for selecting appropriate gear ratios to achieve desired vehicle performance characteristics, such as acceleration and top speed. The diagram emphasizes the importance of the differential in distributing power to the wheels.

![Image](ref_artifacts/image_000023_2e4f36e6665c98a4850a1b738462da8eb645ff5bd7a64346ace8ddc00b5df387.png)

Note: measurement point represents both axle shafts.

Or,

6.1.3.2.2. The  hybrid  power  flow  description  indicates  that  torque  to  the  axle  is  a combined torque  consisting  of  torque  contributions  from  a  set  of  reference points, and all of the torque contributions are routed only to that axle via the same  mechanical  energy  path  between  the  set  of  reference  points  and  the measurement  point,  and  the  manufacturer  provides  an  accurate  K2  factor representing the mechanical conversion efficiency between the set of reference points and the measurement point.

Figure 21 Example of Case 6.1.3.2.2., TP2 applicable to axle. Power at (R1+R2) [kW] = (2π * τ [Nm] * rps [s-1] / 1000) / K2

Here's a technical summary of the figure:

The figure is a simplified schematic representing a drivetrain system, illustrating the flow of power from an input source to the wheels. The system consists of two reduction stages, R1 and R2, followed by a component K2, which represents the engine and transmission, and a final differential stage. The input power is reduced sequentially by R1 and R2 before entering K2. K2 then further modifies the power and transmits it to the differential, which distributes the power to the wheels. The output at the wheels is characterized by torque (τ) and rotational speed (rps). The diagram highlights the cascaded reduction of rotational speed and corresponding increase in torque as power flows through the system. This representation is crucial for understanding the overall gear ratio and torque multiplication achieved by the drivetrain, which is essential for selecting appropriate gear ratios and component sizing to meet desired vehicle performance characteristics.


![Image](ref_artifacts/image_000024_53cdee8982c9d9096602e3cf12734a514b12f8cd17851fc05f740d08dec4f312.png)

Note: measurement point represents both axle shafts.

TP2 is not applicable to an axle if torque contributions from more than one reference  point  are  transmitted  to  the  axle  via  different  mechanical  energy paths, for example, as shown in Figure 22.

Figure 22

Example of TP2 not applicable to axle. Power at R1, R2, or (R1+R2) cannot be resolved from the available measurement

1.  Context: The figure is a schematic diagram representing a drivetrain system, specifically focusing on the power flow and gear relationships within a planetary gearset and differential. The primary objective is to illustrate the torque and rotational speed relationships between the input and output shafts of the system.
2.  Deconstruction: The diagram shows two input shafts, R1 and R2, feeding into a planetary gearset consisting of a sun gear (S), planet gears (P), and a ring gear. The output of the ring gear is then connected to a differential, which distributes power to the wheels. The variables indicated are torque (τ) and rotational speed (rps) at the output shaft of the differential. The diagram highlights that the gear ratio K2 is not applicable to the measurement.
3.  Implication: The diagram illustrates the power flow through the drivetrain, emphasizing the role of the planetary gearset in modifying torque and speed. The absence of K2 in the measurement suggests that the output torque and speed are solely dependent on the gear ratio established by the planetary gearset and the differential. This implies that the overall gear ratio and the differential's characteristics are critical parameters for controlling the vehicle's performance.

![Image](ref_artifacts/image_000025_1f65386e25a4b8892de788559ad4b7243a3c8f8df9bd14272756f9c64942acf4.png)

Note: measurement point represents both axle shafts.

Measurement  devices  installed  within  the  vehicle  shall  be  warmed  up  as appropriate.

- 6.8. Test sequence
- 6.8.1. General

The test shall be carried out in accordance with 6.8.3. to 6.8.8., and 6.9. to 6.10. (see Figure 23). The test shall be stopped immediately if warning indicator(s) with regard to the powertrain turns on.

Note: Warnings are coolant temperature and engine check lamp, for example.

The following operational metrics, if present, shall be monitored and recorded throughout the test: (a) engine coolant temperature, (b) battery temperature (as indicated by temperature of battery cells, modules, or pack, as available), (c) transmission or gearbox oil temperature, (d) battery SOC, (e) electric machine temperature (as indicated by temperature of stator, rotor, or cooling fluid, as available).  The manufacturer shall specify the normal operating range for each operational metric.

- 6.8.2. Speed of maximum power

- 6.8.3. Vehicle conditioning

The measurement devices shall start collecting data.

The object of conditioning is to operate the vehicle until the normal operating temperature ranges specified by the manufacturer (6.1.1.4.) for the temperature-related operational metrics (6.8.1.) have been reached and have stabilized.

- 6.8.4. REESS adjustment

During vehicle conditioning according to 6.8.3., the SOC shall be monitored. The SOC shall be adjusted at the end of vehicle conditioning to the SOC at which maximum  system  power is obtained as recommended  by the manufacturer.  REESS  adjustment  also  applies  to  power  test  repetitions  as directed in 6.8.7.

REESS adjustment may be performed by use of light regenerative braking, or by allowing the vehicle to coast, while the dynamometer is operated in fixed speed mode, or as recommended by the manufacturer. The charge rate by either method  shall  be  monitored  and  shall  be  limited  as  recommended  by  the manufacturer to avoid undue heating of the battery or de-rating of the battery power.

- 6.8.5. Vehicle operation

For vehicles that have driver-selectable modes, the vehicle system power rating that  is  determined  by  this  procedure  may  depend  on  which  mode  is  active during the test. Select the mode for which a vehicle system power rating is desired.

The selected mode shall be recorded as the power-rating mode.

Place the dynamometer in fixed speed mode.

Set the dynamometer fixed speed to the speed of maximum power and allow the speed to stabilize.

- 6.8.6. Power test

The maximum accelerator pedal command shall be given by either the pedal position or by vehicle communication network for a duration of at least 10 s.

The maximum accelerator command shall be given as rapidly as possible. If necessary in order to elicit maximum power delivery, it is permissible to vary the accelerator pedal command as recommended by the manufacturer prior to the maximum accelerator pedal command (for example, ask the manufacturer if it is necessary to achieve a kickdown state).

If  the  gearbox  has  driver-selectable  gears,  the  gear  shall  be  selected  as recommended by the manufacturer for a typical driver to achieve maximum power.  Gear  shifting  by  means  of  special  modes  or  actions  that  are  not available to a typical driver are not permitted.

- 6.8.7. Repetition of power test

The power test of 6.8.6. shall be repeated for a total of five repetitions as shown in Figure 23.

Prior to the second and subsequent repetitions, the REESS shall be adjusted according to 6.8.4.

The temperature-related operational metrics listed in 6.8.1. shall be monitored during all repetitions and seen to remain within the normal operating range specified by the manufacturer during each repetition. Re-condition the vehicle according to 6.8.3. between repetitions if necessary.

Figure 23 Test sequence

1.  Context: The figure is a flowchart outlining the operational and testing procedure for a Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) system, focusing on the Rechargeable Energy Storage System (REESS) and overall power performance. The primary objective is to define the sequence of steps required to prepare, operate, and evaluate the HEV's power characteristics.
2.  Deconstruction: The flowchart begins with REESS initialization and vehicle preparation steps (soak, installation). It then proceeds to vehicle conditioning and REESS adjustment, with a conditional loop allowing for iterative adjustments. The core of the procedure involves vehicle operation, power testing, and repetition of the power test sequence. A decision block checks if five repetitions have been completed; if not, the process loops back to vehicle operation. Upon completion of five repetitions, the vehicle running is ended, and the HEV system power is calculated.
3.  Implication: The flowchart dictates a standardized testing methodology for HEV power evaluation. The iterative REESS adjustment loop suggests a need for calibration or optimization of the energy storage system. The five-repetition power test loop implies a requirement for statistical significance in power measurements, ensuring consistent performance under repeated operation. The final power calculation step provides a quantitative metric for evaluating the HEV system's overall efficiency and performance.

## 6.8.8. End of vehicle running

At  the  end  of  vehicle  running,  the  operational  metrics  (see  6.8.1.)  shall  be recorded.

After the measurements are complete, the vehicle and measurement devices shall be stopped.

## 6.9. Calculation of vehicle system power rating

## 6.9.1. General

For each of the 2nd through 5th repetitions according to 6.8.7., time series data obtained from 6.8 shall be analyzed to calculate vehicle system power.

For each repetition, two power calculations shall be performed:

- (a) Peak  vehicle  system  power:  a  2-second  "peak"  power  that  is  the maximum value of a 2-second moving average filter applied for the 10second measurement time; and
- (b) Sustained vehicle system power: a "sustained" power that defines the average power within the measurement time window from 8 s to 10 s.

For computation purposes, the 10-second measurement time window begins when the accelerator pedal command has reached maximum as indicated by the accelerator pedal command measurement, and the gear ratio (if changed) has begun a period in which it is constant for at least 10 seconds.

If the vehicle design does not provide for a stable gear ratio to be achieved for a full 10 seconds under the maximum power condition, the time window may begin according to the manufacturer's recommendation, with the approval of the responsible authority.

40

Finally, compute the peak and sustained vehicle system power ratings for the vehicle, as the mean of the respective individual results of the four analyzed repetitions.

The variation of each of the four analyzed repetitions shall be computed as a percentage of their mean, and recorded.

The maximum variation of an individual value should not be greater than ± 5% of the mean. If the variation is too large, check the dynamometer settings and vehicle configuration, consult with the manufacturer for possible causes, and perform the repetitions again. If variation cannot be reduced, the system power rating is subject to approval by the responsible authority.

6.9.2. Calculation for TP1

The vehicle system power is calculated as the sum of the power at each of the reference points:

$$V e h i c l e \, s y s t e m \, p o w e r \, [ k W ] = \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } R _ { i }$$

where n is the number of power determination reference points

Ri is the power at the i th reference point [kW]

The power at each Ri is determined according to 6.9.2.1. through 6.9.2.3.:

## 6.9.2.1. For reference points consisting of ICE power:

First determine the ICE power by reference to the full load power curve as a function  of  engine  speed,  applicable  to  the  engine  that  is  installed  in  the vehicle, and subject to confirmation of intake manifold pressure and fuel flow rate. The full load power curve shall be derived from the applicable engine test standard and shall be measured under steady state conditions.

For manufacturers to which engine certification by ISO 1585 or UN Regulation 85  is  applicable  by  regulation,  the  applicable  engine  test  standard  is  ISO 1585:1992 or UN Regulation No. 85, respectively. For other manufacturers, the  applicable  standard  is  that  which  is  applicable  by  local  or  regional regulation. In the case that no engine test standard is applicable by regulation, the applicable standard is SAE J1349 (steady state). The engine dynamometer test fuel shall be as specified in the applicable standard.

To confirm intake manifold pressure and fuel flow rate, compare the measured values to those reported in the certification results of the applicable standard at the measured engine speed.

If:

and

|(𝑔𝑎𝑢𝑔𝑒 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒 𝑎𝑡 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 - 𝑔𝑎𝑢𝑔𝑒 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒 𝑎𝑡 𝑐𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛)| &lt; (0.02)(𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑘𝑒 𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑖𝑓𝑜𝑙𝑑 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒 𝑎𝑡 𝑐𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛)

then Ri is the power indicated by the full load power curve at the measured engine speed.

Otherwise, determine Ri by conducting ISO 1585:1992 or UN Regulation No. 85 (as applicable)  under the observed conditions using the above-measured engine speed, intake manifold pressure and fuel flow rate, or ask the vehicle manufacturer for support in determining the ICE power under the observed conditions.

$$| ( m e a s u r e d \ f u e l \ f l o w \ r a t e - \ f u e l \ f l o w \ r a t e \ a t \ c e r t i f i c a t i o n ) | \\ < ( 0 . 0 2 ) ( f u e l \ f l o w \ r a t e \ a t \ c e r t i f i c a t i o n )$$

Note: if any portion of Ri is routed to charge the REESS, the electrical power entering the REESS shall be accounted for as negative power under 6.9.2.2.

6.9.2.2. For  reference  points  consisting  of  electric  machine  power,  and  where  the measurement point is the REESS output:

Ri shall be determined by the equation:

$$R _ { i } \left [ k W \right ] = \left ( \frac { U _ { R E E S S } \times I _ { R E E S S } } { 1 0 0 0 } - P _ { D C D C } - P _ { a u x } \right ) \times K 1$$

where

UREESS is the measured REESS voltage [V]

IREESS is the measured REESS current [A] (negative if flowing into the REESS)

PDCDC is  the  power  to  DC/DC  converter  for  12V  auxiliaries,  if present (either 1.0 kW or measured value) [kW]

Paux is the power to high-voltage auxiliaries powered by the REESS, other than PDCDC, if present and operating during the test (measured or  estimated  value)  [kW].  If  estimated,  the  manufacturer  shall provide  evidence  supporting  the estimated value. Use  of the estimated value is subject to approval by the responsible authority.

K1 is the conversion factor from DC electrical power to mechanical power as described in 6.1.1.2. and 6.1.3.1.

If  K1 represents a conversion to the sum of the power at a set of reference points (for example, (R1+R2) as depicted in Figure 18), the equation computes the sum of the power at the set of reference points.

If PDCDC and Paux are measured, they are calculated as:

$$P _ { D C D C } \left [ k W \right ] = ( U _ { D C D C } \times I _ { D C D C } ) \ / 1 0 0 0$$

𝑃 𝑎𝑢𝑥 [𝑘𝑊] = (𝑈𝑎𝑢𝑥 × 𝐼 𝑎𝑢𝑥 )  / 1000 (for each applicable auxiliary)

where

U DCDC is the voltage to DC/DC converter for 12V auxiliaries [V]

I DCDC is the current to DC/DC converter for 12V auxiliaries [A]

U aux is the voltage to the auxiliary [V]

I aux is the current to the auxiliary [A]

6.9.2.3. For  reference  points  consisting  of  electric  machine  power,  and  where  the measurement point is the inverter input:

Ri shall be determined by the equation:

$$R _ { i } \left [ k W \right ] = \left ( \frac { U _ { I n p u t } \times \, I _ { I n p u t } } { 1 0 0 0 } \right ) \times K 1$$

where

UInput is the measured DC voltage at the inverter input [V]

I Input is the measured current at the inverter input [A]

K1 is the conversion factor from DC electrical power to mechanical power as described in 6.1.1.2. and 6.1.3.1.

If  K1 represents a conversion to the sum of the power at a set of reference points  (for  example,  if  the  inverter  powers  a  set  of  electric  machines),  the equation computes the sum of the power at the set of reference points.

- 6.9.3. Calculation for TP2

## 6.9.3.1. Calculation

The vehicle system power is calculated as the sum of the power at each of the reference points:

$$V e h i c l e \, s y s t e m \, p o w e r \, [ k W ] = \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } R _ { i }$$

The power at each reference point is calculated as:

$$R _ { i } \left [ k W \right ] = \left ( \frac { P _ { a x x l e } } { K 2 } \right )$$

Where

Paxle is the power measured at the respective powered axle [kW]:

$$P _ { a x l e } \left [ k W \right ] & = \left ( 2 \pi \times a x l e \ s h a f t \ o r \, w h e e l \ s p e e d \left [ r e v \bullet s ^ { - 1 } \right ] \right ) \\ & \quad \times a x l e \ s h a f t \ o r \, w h e e l \ t o r q u e \left [ N n \right ] \right ) / 1 0 0 0$$

K2 is the mechanical energy conversion efficiency factor K2 applicable to the axle as described in 6.1.1.2. and 6.1.3.2.

If  K2 represents a conversion to the sum of the power at a set of reference points (for example, (R1+R2) as depicted in Figure 21), the equation computes the sum of the power at the set of reference points.

## 6.9.3.2. ICE power correction

The ICE power portion of the vehicle system power rating shall be corrected according to the provision given in ISO 1585:1992 clause 6, if:

-  the  reference  atmospheric  and  temperature  conditions,  given  in  ISO 1585:1992 clause 6.2.1; or

- the automatic control conditions according to ISO 1585:1992, clause 6.3

cannot be fulfilled.

Note:  if  the  applicable  standard  according  to  6.9.2.1  is  not  ISO  1585  (for example, UN Regulation No. 85), ICE power correction shall be performed according to the equivalent portions of the applicable standard (for example, UN Regulation No. 85 clause 5).

If  the  ICE  power  portion  needs  to  be  corrected,  follow  6.9.3.3.,  otherwise continue with 6.10.

## 6.9.3.3. Corrected vehicle system power rating for TP2

ICE power correction requires a distinct value for the ICE power portion (PICE) of the vehicle system power rating.

For many powertrain architectures, TP2 does not deliver a distinct value for the ICE power portion. For example, Figure 24 shows a powertrain where TP2 would apply a K2 factor to the power measured at the axles, delivering the sum of R1 (PICE) and R2 (Pnon-ICE) instead of a distinct value for each.

Figure 24 Example of powertrain where TP2 does not deliver a distinct value for ICE power (R1)

1.  Context: The figure is a schematic diagram representing the power flow in a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) powertrain. It illustrates the interaction between the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE), the Rechargeable Energy Storage System (REESS), and the Electric Motor (EM) to deliver power to the wheels.

2.  Deconstruction: The diagram shows the REESS connected to the EM via an Inverter (Inv). The EM and ICE are mechanically coupled through a system represented by R1, R2, and K2, which likely represents a transmission or power split device. R1 represents the power flow from the ICE (P_ICE), while R2 represents the power flow from the EM (P_non-ICE). The combined power (R1+R2) is then transmitted through K2 to the wheels. TP2 indicates a measurement point on the drivetrain.

3.  Implication: The diagram highlights the power blending strategy in the HEV. It shows how the ICE and EM can contribute individually or jointly to propel the vehicle. The power split ratio between the ICE and EM, determined by R1 and R2, is a critical design parameter for optimizing fuel efficiency and performance. The measurement point TP2 is important for validating the power flow model and assessing the overall system efficiency.


![Image](ref_artifacts/image_000027_5d71d8608ab6a80ba3194620d6dae6ac006137f61c6453c83acf61628cc24148.png)

Note: measurement point represents both axle shafts.

If TP2 does not provide a distinct value for PICE, perform steps (a) through (c) below to derive PICE by subtracting the power at the non-ICE reference points that were summed with the ICE reference point.

Otherwise, proceed with step (d).

- (a) Identify  the  set  of  summed  reference  points  that  includes  the  ICE reference point, and their summed power as delivered by TP2 (Psummed).
- (b) Perform TP1 to determine the power at each of the non-ICE reference points  in  the  set,  and  sum  them  together  to  determine  the  non-ICE portion (Psummed, non-ICE).
- (c) Subtract the power at the non-ICE reference points (Psummed, non-ICE) from the  summed power (Psummed). The result is the measured ICE power, PICE:

$$P _ { I C E } [ k W ] = P _ { s u m m e d } \left [ k W \right ] - P _ { s u m m e d , n o n - I C E } \left [ k W \right ]$$

- (d) Correct the measured ICE power according to ISO 1585:1992 (or the applicable standard, if different, according to 6.9.2.1):

𝑃𝐼𝐶𝐸,𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑 [𝑘𝑊] = 𝑃𝐼𝐶𝐸 [𝑘𝑊] × (𝑃𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟)

where Power correction factor is according to ISO 1585:1992, clause 6  (or  the  equivalent  portion  of  the  applicable  standard,  if  different, according to 6.9.2.1).

- (e) Compute the corrected vehicle system power rating as the sum of the corrected ICE power and the power at all non-ICE reference points in the powertrain:

$$\ V e h i c l e { s y s t e m } \ p o w { r _ { c o r r e c t e d } } \left [ k W \right ] \\ = \left ( \sum _ { \ } R _ { a l l } \ n o n { - I C E } \left [ k W \right ] \right ) + \ P _ { I C E , c o r r e c t e d } \left [ k W \right ]$$

$$= ( \sum _ { I } R _ { a l l \ n o n - I C E } [ k W ] ) + P _ { I C E , c o r r e c t e d } [ k W ]$$

Note :  Ask  the  manufacturer if the vehicle control system adjusts the power output of electric machine(s) to electrically compensate for variation in ICE power output due to altitude or air temperature. In this case, the amount of electrical  compensation  shall  be  subtracted  from  the  vehicle  system  power rating after the power correction is performed.

- 6.10. Internal validation of vehicle system power rating

The  vehicle  system  power  rating  according  to  TP1  or  TP2  shall  fulfill  the following requirement:

44

The implied downstream efficiency between the reference point(s) and the road shall  not  be  greater  than  1.  Implied  downstream  efficiency  is  computed  by dividing the average power recorded at the dynamometer rollers (or hub dyno if applicable) between the 8th and 10th second by the sustained vehicle system power result (prior to any correction under 6.9.3.3.

## Annex 1

## Identification of power determination reference points

1. General approach
2. 1.1. Both TP1 and TP2 convert a set of specified vehicle test measurements to a vehicle system power rating that represents the mechanical power transmitted through one or more power determination reference points.
3. 1.2. Power determination reference points are intended to represent points in the mechanical  power  flow  path  of  an  electrified  powertrain  that  are  most analogous  to  the  engine  output  shaft  in  a  conventional  vehicle.  Here, "analogous" means being a point in the powertrain where mechanical power that drives the wheels is first produced from stored energy. This is consistent with the tradition that conventional vehicles are assigned a system power rating equal  to  the  rated  power  of  the  engine,  without  consideration  of  the  power losses that occur downstream of the engine output shaft.
4. 1.3. A power determination reference point is a point in the mechanical power flow path  of  an  electrified  powertrain  as  defined  in  paragraph  3.5.  In  the  most general  sense,  reference  points  represent  where  the  mechanical  power  that drives the wheels during the maximum power condition is first produced from an energy storage system. A given electrified powertrain may include one or more  power  determination  reference  points  as  necessary  to  account  for  all sources of propulsion power to the powered axle(s). The vehicle system power rating is the sum of the power transmitted through all of the reference points.
5. 1.4. Reference points for complex electrified powertrains can vary depending on the specific power flow paths that are active in a given operating mode of the vehicle  or  at  a  given  power  demand.  For  the  purpose  of  system  power determination under this GTR, reference points shall be identified according to the requirements of this Annex.
6. 1.5. Calculation of the vehicle system power rating under both TP1 and TP2 shall result in an estimate of the sum of the power at all of the identified reference points during the maximum power condition. The same reference points shall apply to a given powertrain regardless of whether TP1 or TP2 is applied.
2. Identifying power determination reference points
8. 2.1. General considerations
9. 2.1.1. Power determination reference points represent all of the sources of the total mechanical power that is transmitted to the road during the maximum power condition. This means that they are based not only on powertrain architectural layout  but  also  on  the  state  of  the  powertrain  during  the  maximum  power condition and on any applicable operating mode. Propulsion energy converters that are not operating or are not contributing propulsion energy to the road in this state are not included.
10. 2.2. Parallel architectures
11. 2.2.1. The power determination reference points for parallel architectures (example in Figure 25) are generally (a) the engine mechanical power output shaft and (b) the mechanical power output shaft(s) of any electric machines that provide mechanical power to the road. The vehicle system power rating is the sum of the power passing through the reference points.

## Figure 25

Example  of  power  determination  reference  points  R1  and  R2  for  a  simple  parallel architecture.

1.  Context: The figure is a schematic diagram representing the powertrain architecture of a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). It illustrates the functional relationships between the energy storage system, internal combustion engine, electric motor, and drivetrain components. The primary objective is to depict the power flow and component integration within the HEV system.

2.  Deconstruction: The diagram includes a Rechargeable Energy Storage System (REESS) connected to an Inverter (Inv) and Electric Motor (EM) assembly (K1). The Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) is mechanically linked to the EM via a junction (R2). The ICE's output is monitored for speed (rev/min) and is subject to UNR 85 testing. The combined output drives a transmission (K2) connected to the vehicle's wheels. Measurement points TP1 and TP2 are indicated at the REESS and the wheels, respectively.

3.  Implication: The diagram highlights a parallel hybrid configuration where both the ICE and EM can independently or jointly power the vehicle. The presence of R1 and R2 indicates potential gear ratios or clutches for managing power distribution. The measurement points TP1 and TP2 are critical for assessing the overall system efficiency and performance, allowing for the analysis of energy consumption and vehicle dynamics. The UNR 85 test results for the ICE are important for regulatory compliance and emissions analysis.

![Image](ref_artifacts/image_000028_b83f7806524ece563434d2b17f5a00ff55b240f571f190f9c0160e43e2b91db7.png)

Note: measurement point for TP2 represents both axle shafts.

- 2.2.2. In Figure 25, the electric machine EM directly drives the engine output shaft. The reference points are R1 and R2.
- 2.2.3. Here TP1 may be performed by measuring engine speed, manifold pressure, and fuel flow rate (with reference to the full load power curve) to determine the power at R1, and measuring REESS current and voltage (corrected by K1) to determine the power at R2.
- 2.2.4. TP2 may be performed by measuring the torque and speed at the drive wheels or axle hubs (corrected by K2) to determine the sum of R1 and R2.
- 2.3. Power split architectures
- 2.3.1. Power split architectures (example, Figure 26) often have more than one input and/or output to a complex gearbox that may include one or more planetary gear  sets,  and  may  also  include  a  series  power  conversion  path  that  mixes power from the ICE with power from the REESS. The power determination reference points for such  an  architecture are generally (a) the  engine mechanical power output shaft and (b) the mechanical power output shaft(s) of  any  electric  machines  that  provide  mechanical  power  to  the  road.  With regard to (b), in the case that the mechanical power delivered by the electric machine includes power sourced from the ICE, only the portion of the power that  originates  from  the  REESS  is  counted  (R2REESS  in  Figure  26).  The vehicle system power rating is the sum of the power passing through R1 and R2REESS.

Figure 26

## Example of power determination reference points R1 and R2REESS for a simple power split architecture.

1.  Context: The figure is a schematic diagram representing the power flow in a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) powertrain. It illustrates the interaction between an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE), a Regenerative Electrical Energy Storage System (REESS), and a Motor Generator (MG) unit, focusing on the mechanical power transfer paths.

2.  Deconstruction: The diagram shows the ICE connected to a planetary gear set (S, P, Ring) with a power split. The MG, controlled by Inverter 1 (Inv1), is also connected to the ring gear. The REESS is connected to the MG via Inv1 and to the generator (G) via Inverter 2 (Inv2). Red arrows indicate mechanical power flow from the ICE and G, while purple arrows indicate mechanical power flow to the wheels. Blue arrows indicate electrical power flow between the REESS, Inverters, and MG. R1 represents the mechanical power from the ICE, and R2_REESS represents the mechanical power from the MG. The engine speed (rev/min) is monitored. TP1 indicates a measurement point for the REESS.

3.  Implication: The diagram highlights the parallel hybrid architecture, where both the ICE and MG can contribute to the vehicle's propulsion. The planetary gear set enables power splitting and blending between the ICE and MG. The REESS provides energy storage for regenerative braking and electric drive. The design must consider the power ratings of the ICE, MG, and REESS, as well as the gear ratios within the planetary gear set, to optimize fuel efficiency and performance. The control strategy for the inverters (Inv1, Inv2) is critical for managing power flow between the REESS, MG, and ICE.

![Image](ref_artifacts/image_000029_b3af6d1527bc8bb9b6906672675a4983077a7618d167fecc91a4b672b4a5b3ff.png)

- 2.3.2. Here, TP1 may be performed by measuring engine speed, manifold pressure, and fuel flow rate (with reference to the full load power curve) to determine the power at R1, and measuring REESS current and voltage (corrected by K1) to determine the power at R2REESS. K1 should be chosen to represent the net efficiency of the Inv1+MG combination when transmitting all of the depicted power (of both the series path and the REESS).
- 2.3.3. As indicated by the applicability guidelines under 6.1.3.2, TP2 is not applicable because the power arriving at the axle is a combination of power flows that experience different conversion efficiencies, making it impractical to reconstruct the power at R1 and R2REESS from a single measurement of axle power.

## 2.4. Pure series architectures

- 2.4.1. Pure series architectures (example, Figure 27) include an ICE that powers one or  more  electrical  conversion  paths  with  no  mechanical  link  between  the engine and the road. The power determination reference points are generally (a) the engine mechanical power output shaft and (b) the mechanical power output shaft(s) of any electric machines that provide mechanical power to the road. With regard to (b), in the case that the mechanical power delivered by an electric machine includes power sourced from the ICE, only the portion of the power  that  originates  from  the  REESS  is  counted  (R2REESS).  The  vehicle system power rating is the sum of the power passing through R1 and R2REESS.

Figure 27

## Example of power determination reference points for a pure series architecture

1.  Context: The figure is a schematic diagram representing the power flow within a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) powertrain. Its primary objective is to illustrate the energy transfer pathways between the internal combustion engine (ICE), regenerative energy storage system (REESS), and the vehicle's wheels.

2.  Deconstruction: The diagram depicts the ICE and REESS as primary power sources. The ICE output (R1) can directly drive the wheels or power a generator (G) via inverter 2 (Inv2). The REESS connects to the powertrain via inverter 1 (Inv1) and a motor/generator (MG). The MG can provide torque to the wheels (R2_REESS) or act as a generator to charge the REESS. The dotted box (K1) encapsulates the inverter 1 and MG. Measurement point TP1 is located on the REESS.

3.  Implication: The diagram highlights the parallel hybrid architecture, where both the ICE and REESS can independently or jointly power the vehicle. The presence of inverters and a motor/generator enables regenerative braking and electric-only driving modes. The power split between the ICE and REESS, represented by R1 and R2_REESS, is a critical design parameter for optimizing fuel efficiency and emissions. The UNR 85 test results are related to the ICE.

![Image](ref_artifacts/image_000030_21255c1b6d176068f3783bf4572b2d2a55bd0a3f3a0262b82f1883bd63dc5f36.png)

- 2.4.2. Here, TP1 may be performed by measuring engine speed, manifold pressure, and fuel flow rate (with reference to the full load power curve) to determine the power at R1, and measuring REESS current and voltage (corrected by K1) to determine the power at R2REESS. K1 should be chosen to represent the net efficiency of the Inv1+MG combination when transmitting all of the depicted power (of both the series path and the REESS).
- 2.4.3. As indicated by the applicability guidelines under 6.1.3.2, TP2 is not applicable because the power arriving at the axle is a combination of power flows that experience different conversion efficiencies, making it impractical to reconstruct the power at R1 and R2REESS from a single measurement of axle power.
- 2.5. Architectures with more than one powered axle
- 2.5.1. When  more  than  one  axle  propels  the  vehicle  under  the  maximum  power condition, the vehicle must be tested at both axles simultaneously. If each axle is  not  powered  by  the  same  set  of  propulsion  energy  converters,  there  will commonly be reference points associated with a specific axle. An example is shown in Figure 28. Power at R1 and R2 is delivered to one axle while power at R3 is delivered to the other axle. The vehicle system power rating is the sum of the power passing through R1, R2, and R3.

Figure 28

Example of an architecture with more than one powered axle each receiving power through different reference points

1.  Context: The figure is a schematic diagram of a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) powertrain architecture. It illustrates the power flow between the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE), Regenerative Energy Storage System (REESS), and two Motor-Generator units (MG1 and MG2) to the vehicle's wheels. The diagram highlights the mechanical coupling points (R1, R2, R3) and gear ratios (K1(1), K1(2), K2(1), K2(2)) within the powertrain.

2.  Deconstruction: The ICE is directly connected to the front wheels via a transmission (K2(1)). MG1 is coupled to the ICE crankshaft via a gear ratio K1(1) and can provide torque assist or regenerative braking. The REESS is connected to MG1 and MG2 via inverters (Inv1 and Inv2). MG2 is connected to the rear wheels via a gear ratio K1(2) and a differential (K2(2)). Measurement points TP1 and TP2 are indicated for data acquisition. The ICE is subject to UNR 85 testing.

3.  Implication: The diagram reveals a parallel hybrid architecture with potential for all-wheel drive. The gear ratios K1 and K2 are critical design parameters for optimizing torque distribution, fuel efficiency, and regenerative braking performance. The measurement points TP1 and TP2 are essential for validating the powertrain model and control strategy. The UNR 85 test results are used to evaluate the ICE performance.

Note: measurement points for TP2 represent both axle shafts.

- 2.5.2. Here, TP1 may be performed by measuring engine speed, manifold pressure, and fuel flow rate (with reference to the full load power curve) to determine the power at R1, and measuring the current and voltage at the input to each of Inv1 and Inv2 (correcting by K1(1) and K1(2), respectively) to determine the power at R2 and R3 (alternatively, instrumentation of the REESS instead of the inverters may be applicable under the conditions described in 6.1.3.1).
- 2.5.3. TP2 may be performed by measuring the torque and speed at the right-side axle (corrected by K2(1)) to determine the sum of R1 and R2, and measuring the torque and speed at the left-side axle (corrected by K2(2)) to determine R3.

## 2.6. Other architectures

- 2.6.1. Reference  points  for  other  architectures  not  listed  in  this  Annex,  or  for variations in the listed architectures, shall be selected in conformity with the definition  of  power  determination  reference  point  in  3.5  and  in  a  manner consistent  with  the  principles  and  guidelines  discussed  herein.  Selection  of power determination reference points is subject to approval by the responsible authority.

## Annex 2

## Determination of speed of maximum power

1. The speed of maximum power (defined in 3.5.) is the maximum value in the relation between power and speed (see Figure 29), where power is the power delivered to the dynamometer and speed is the speed of the vehicle operating in fixed speed mode on a dynamometer.
2. The speed of maximum power shall be determined either by the manufacturer or the responsible authority by the procedure described in this Annex.
3. The  speed  of  maximum  power  shall  be  identified  by  conducting  the  test sequence depicted in Figure 30 at a series of operating points (fixed vehicle speeds) in order to identify the speed at which maximum power occurs.
4. The series of operating points should be spaced closely enough to identify the speed of maximum power with good confidence. The operating points may initially be chosen to cover a range of speeds at a coarse resolution, followed by a finer resolution to identify the speed where peak power is obtained.
5. The  power  delivered  to  the  dynamometer  at  each  operating  point  may  be determined by reference to dynamometer power data, or dynamometer speed and torque data, where available.
6. Once determined, the speed of maximum power shall be reported in kilometres per hour as a whole number.
7. If the vehicle manufacturer has specified the speed of maximum power and verification is desired, run at slightly different speeds above and below the specified speed to confirm that a peak exists at the specified speed.

Figure 29

## Relation between power and speed

Speed [km/h]

1.  Context: The figure is a plot illustrating the power output characteristics of a Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) system. The primary objective is to show the relationship between an unspecified independent variable (likely related to engine speed or vehicle speed, but not explicitly labeled) and the resulting power output in kilowatts (kW).
2.  Deconstruction: The plot shows power [kW] on the vertical axis. The horizontal axis is unlabeled, but represents a variable related to the HEV's operating condition. The curve shows an initial increase in power as the independent variable increases, reaching a maximum power output, and then a subsequent decrease in power as the independent variable continues to increase. The region around the maximum power is highlighted.
3.  Implication: The plot indicates that the HEV system has an optimal operating range where it produces maximum power. System design and control strategies should aim to maintain operation within this range to maximize efficiency and performance. The unlabeled x-axis prevents a more detailed analysis.

Figure 30

## Test sequence for determination of speed of maximum power

1.  Context: The figure is a flowchart outlining the operational testing procedure for a vehicle equipped with a Rechargeable Energy Storage System (REESS) on a dynamometer. The primary objective is to characterize the vehicle's performance across various operating points and determine the speed at which maximum power is achieved.
2.  Deconstruction: The flowchart begins with REESS charging and vehicle preparation. The core testing loop involves setting the dynamometer to a constant speed corresponding to an operating point, adjusting the REESS, operating the vehicle, and performing a power test. An optional repetition of the power test is included. If all operating points have not been tested, the dynamometer speed is adjusted to the next operating point, and the loop repeats, with optional vehicle conditioning. The loop continues until all operating points are tested.
3.  Implication: This flowchart provides a structured approach to vehicle testing, ensuring consistent and repeatable measurements across different operating conditions. The iterative process allows for comprehensive performance evaluation and identification of the vehicle's optimal operating speed for maximum power output. The optional vehicle conditioning step highlights the importance of maintaining consistent vehicle state during testing. The design implications are that the test setup must allow for precise dynamometer speed control, REESS adjustment, and accurate power measurement at each operating point.
