The provided image is a schematic representation of a geographic projection system. The primary objective is to illustrate a specific method for mapping a three-dimensional spherical surface (Earth) onto a two-dimensional plane. The figure depicts a polar azimuthal equidistant projection, centered on the North Pole. Concentric circles represent lines of equal distance from the center, while radial lines represent lines of constant bearing from the center. The landmasses are distorted, particularly at lower latitudes, with areas further from the center appearing larger than their actual size relative to areas near the center. This projection preserves distances from the center point but sacrifices shape and area accuracy elsewhere. The design implication is that this projection is suitable for applications where maintaining accurate distances from a central point is critical, such as radio wave propagation analysis or emergency response planning centered on a specific location, but is unsuitable for applications requiring accurate area or shape representation.

1. Context: The figure presents a QR code, a two-dimensional barcode designed to encode data for machine readability. The primary engineering objective is to provide a compact and reliable method for storing and retrieving information, typically a URL or other alphanumeric string.
2. Deconstruction: The QR code consists of a square grid of black and white modules. The arrangement of these modules encodes the data. Three larger square patterns at the corners are position detection markers, enabling the reader to determine the code's orientation and perspective. The remaining modules encode the data itself, including error correction information. The density of the modules determines the amount of data that can be stored.
3. Implication: The QR code allows for efficient data transfer to scanning devices. The inclusion of error correction ensures data integrity even with partial damage or obstruction of the code. The design implication is that this QR code can be used to encode a URL or other information, allowing users to quickly access relevant data by scanning the code with a compatible device. The specific data encoded within the QR code is not apparent from the image alone and would need to be decoded to determine its exact content.

## I. Statement of technical rationale and justification

## A. Introduction

1. Owing to the pressing need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) and other air pollutants, the market share of electrified vehicles is expected to grow in the future. A key component of these vehicles is the traction battery that is used to store and deliver energy to power  the  movement  of  the  vehicle  and  the  systems  within  it.  Improvements  in  the performance  of  batteries  to  deliver  increased  driving  range,  reduced  charging  times  and greater affordability are a significant focus for manufacturers and technological developments in this area are expected to accelerate the uptake of electrified vehicles by consumers.
2. Despite the expected improvements in the performance of new electrified vehicles, the continued in-use performance of the battery over time is not currently regulated.  The primary motivation for this GTR therefore stems from the recognition that the environmental performance of electrified  vehicles  may  be  affected  by  excess  degradation  of  the  battery system over time.
3. Loss of electric range and loss of vehicle energy efficiency are both primary concerns. Loss of electric range could lead to a loss of utility, meaning electric vehicles are driven less and therefore displace less distance travelled that might otherwise be driven in conventional vehicles. A loss in utility could also dampen consumer sentiment and curb the market growth necessary for electric vehicle sales to deliver on fleet emissions reductions. Loss of vehicle efficiency  could  impact  the  upstream  emissions  by  increasing  the  amount  of  electricity needed per vehicle distance travelled. Both can affect not only the utility of the vehicle to the consumer, but also the environmental  performance of the vehicle. Loss of environmental performance  is  important,  in  particular  because  governmental  regulatory  compliance programs often  credit  electrified  vehicles  with  a  certain  level  of  expected  environmental benefit, which might not be realized over the life of the vehicle if excess battery degradation occurs.
4. In addition to changes in range and energy consumption, hybrid electric vehicles are often equipped with both a conventional and electric powertrain, and for these vehicles the criteria  pollutant  emissions  from  the  conventional  powertrain  could  be  impacted  by  the degradation of the battery over time.
5. This  GTR  therefore  aims  to  provide  a  harmonised  methodology  to  address  these concerns by introducing a method by which the health of the battery can be monitored over time and by setting minimum performance requirements for the durability of the battery.

## B. Procedural background

6. The Informal Working Group (IWG) on Electric Vehicle and the Environment (EVE) was set up in June 2012 following the approval by WP.29/AC.3 of ECE/TRANS/WP.29/AC.3/32. This document established two  distinct  IWGs  to  examine environmental  and  safety  issues  related  to  Electric  Vehicles  (EVs):  the  IWG  on  EVE, reporting to the Working Party on Pollution and Energy (GRPE), and the IWG on Electric Vehicle  Safety  (EVS),  reporting  to  the  Working  Party  on  Passive  Safety  (GRSP).  The proposal was supported by the European Commission, the United States of America, China, and Japan.
7. A second mandate for the IWG on EVE, divided into Parts A and B was approved in November 2014 by AC.3 to conduct additional research to address several recommendations that  grew  out  of  the  first  mandate,  and  develop  UN  GTR(s),  if  appropriate.  The  second mandate was separate from the IWG on EVS.
8. Part A of the second mandate of the IWG on EVE (ECE/TRANS/WP.29/AC.3/40) included 'battery performance and durability' as one of the topics authorized for study and potential GTR development. Specifically, Part A authorized activity 'to further develop the recommendations  for  future  work  outlined  in  the  Electric  Vehicle  Regulatory  Reference

Guide by: (i) conducting additional research to support the recommendations; (ii) identifying which recommendations are suitable for the development of (a) global technical regulation(s) (GTR(s)) by the World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations (WP.29); and (iii) developing a work plan. The work of the IWG on EVE on battery performance and durability under  Part  A  of  the  EVE  mandate  was  reported  to  WP.29  in  a  status  report  as  informal document WP.29-170-31 at the 170 th  meeting of WP.29, 15-18 November 2016.

9. At the close of Part A the IWG on EVE recommended that GRPE and WP.29 endorse the option of extending the mandate of the IWG on EVE to continue active research into the topic of battery performance and durability without committing to the development of a GTR at that time. This was endorsed and work continued on this topic within Part B of the mandate.
10. The IWG on EVE presented a draft status report to GRPE in May 2019 on the research on in-vehicle battery durability and performance. The status report indicated that there was sufficient information to allow a UN GTR for in-vehicle battery durability to be started. The IWG on EVE recommended at the 79 th  GRPE in May 2019 that the UN GTR on in-vehicle battery durability be developed under a new mandate.
11. AC.3  subsequently  approved  document  ECE/TRANS/WP.29/AC.3/57  authorizing the IWG on EVE to develop a new UN GTR on in-vehicle battery durability which will be developed in 2 phases:

Phase 1:

- (a) Deliver a first version of a UN GTR on in-vehicle battery durability to AC.3 by November 2021 with;
- (i) Definition  of  and  requirements  for  electrified  vehicle  battery  performance criteria
- (ii) Requirements  for  reading  and/or  displaying  battery  health  information  and usage data from the vehicle; and
- (iii) A  provisional  in-service  conformity  test  which  will  include  generic  usage criteria and a statistical method.

Phase 2:

- (b) Develop a second version of the UN GTR on in-vehicle battery durability with the following:
- (i) The development of a methodology to define Normal Usage Indices (NUI) based on data read from vehicles
- (ii) Refined  performance  criteria  requirements  for  in-vehicle  battery  durability through assessment of further modelling and data collected from real vehicles and the use of NUIs

## C. Technical background

## Battery degradation in electrified vehicles

12. The effect of battery degradation on environmental performance is likely to differ significantly  among  the  various  electrified  vehicle  architectures  (PEV,  OVC-HEV  and NOVC-HEV). The primary forms of battery degradation are capacity degradation and power degradation. Capacity degradation is the loss of energy capacity, resulting in a loss of electric driving range (for PEVs and OVC-HEVs) and possibly increased use of the engine during hybrid operation (for NOVC-HEVs). Power degradation is the loss of battery power, which can also lead to increased use of the engine for OVC-HEV and NOVC-HEVs and possibly reduced performance of the vehicle overall.
13. There are at least six major vehicle operating parameters that affect in-vehicle battery durability. Each differs in importance depending on electrified vehicle architecture:

- (a) Discharge  rates,  as  determined  by  vehicle  duty  cycle  and  operator  use including, but not limited to, vehicle speed, auxiliary loads, towing, payload and ambient conditions;
- (b) Charge rates, as determined by type (normal, fast, super-fast) and frequency of charging;
- (c) State of charge (SOC) window used in system operation of the battery and the amount typically used between charge events (depth of discharge);
- (d) Battery  temperature  during  operation  (operation  includes  all  temperature exposures from vehicle purchase through retirement, both while being operated and during periods of charging and inactivity);
- (e) Time (calendar life);
- (f) Other uses not reflected in calendar life or distance travelled, such as Vehicle to Grid (V2G).
14. The extent and nature of battery degradation that will occur is  a result of complex mechanisms and heavily dependent on the battery cell chemistry and operating conditions. A variety of physical and electrochemical processes influence the durability of battery cells and these have been documented comprehensively within a literature review commissioned by the  IWG  on  EVE.  For  typical  lithium-ion  batteries  the  primary  mechanisms  leading  to capacity degradation were summarised as:
- (a) Loss or deposition of cyclable lithium or a loss of balance between electrodes;
- (b) Loss of electrode area; and
- (c) Loss of electrode material or conductivity.
15. These  aging  processes  are  often  further  complicated  by  the  fact  that  many  of  the mechanisms are associated with a rise in cell impedance, leading to a reduction in maximum cell power.

## Management of battery degradation

16. Whilst manufacturers have found  it possible to establish the  durability  of  specific battery implementations sufficiently to bring the products to market with some degree of confidence that normal provisions for customer satisfaction and warranty terms are being met,  not  every  manufacturer  is  establishing  durability  in  the  same  way.  Manufacturers employ a wide variety of testing regimes often tailored to specific product configurations, applications, customer groups, and geographic considerations.
17. To reduce the effect of capacity degradation on range, manufacturers may choose to slightly  oversize  a  PEV  or  OVC-HEV  battery  to  allow  the  range  to  be  maintained  by widening of the state-of-charge (SOC) window to make more capacity available as capacity degrades.  Others  may  choose  to  design  for  a  beginning-of-life  range,  and  account  for degradation  by  warranting  the  battery  to  a  specified  degree  of  capacity  retention  over  a specified period of time or distance travelled. In the latter case, the consumer is expected to understand that a potential reduction in electric range is to be expected during the life of the vehicle.
18. Despite the expected loss of electric range and battery capacity retention over time, regulatory practice does not uniformly account for it. For example, US EPA range labelling rules  for  PEVs  and  OVC-HEVs  effectively  treat  driving  range  as  a  beginning-of-life criterion, by measuring range at beginning of-life and omitting any adjustment for future capacity  degradation,  while  still  accounting  for  some  cold  temperature  and  high  speed operation. For OVC-HEVs, however, manufacturers are indirectly compelled to account for degradation in range, in that it directly affects the calculated in-use emissions later in life. OVC-HEV greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are calculated using the SAE J1711 procedure, which accounts for utility factor, a function of all-electric range. If range degrades during useful life, the utility factor correction would change and thus, the calculated GHG emissions would increase. Because vehicles are considered noncompliant if their emissions exceed the certified emission level by more than 10 percent during the useful life, manufacturers that do

not  factor  capacity  degradation  into  their  OVC-HEV  designs  risk  exceeding  the  GHG standards in-use. Accordingly, for OVC-HEVs, manufacturers typically use a combination of battery oversizing and an energy management strategy that provides for a consistent range throughout the useful life.

19. A  number  of  further  measures  are  employed  by  manufacturers  to  limit  battery degradation. These typically include, but are not limited to, the use of properly optimised battery  management  systems  (BMS)  and  battery  thermal  management.  BMS  can  reduce stress on the battery and prolong battery life by controlling some operations to protect the battery  cells,  maintain  cell  charge  balancing  and  moderate  the  battery  temperature.  For example, BMS might control enhanced cooling systems, limit fast charging events through modulation of the charging current, control the available state of charge window, keep the cell  voltages  balanced,  or  reduce  the  maximum  available  torque  as  necessary  to  protect battery health. The inputs to BMS can include anything from ambient conditions and driver behaviour to individual cell metrics. Each manufacturer, vehicle, battery and cell could have unique and highly optimised BMS, that are updated and improved with every iteration. BMS are very complex and generally considered highly proprietary and should not be tampered with  out  of  environmental  and  safety  concerns.  Another  important  factor  is  the  battery thermal management capability. While some batteries are only passively cooled by ambient air, others are actively cooled and heated by use of forced air, liquid coolant, or refrigerant, which leads to greater BMS control over battery operating temperature and hence longer life.

## Prediction and/or estimation of battery degradation

20. Accelerated aging is a familiar technique used by many manufacturers as a component of their battery durability testing methods. This technique assumes that a  regime of rapid aging cycles can be translated to a projected useful life in service. However, it is uncertain whether  the  translation  from  accelerated  aging  to  an  in-use  life  projection  is  equally applicable to all forms of lithium-ion chemistries either currently in use or in the future.
21. One of the major mechanisms by which capacity and power degradation occurs in these chemistries is the microscopic fragmentation that accompanies swelling and contraction  of  anode  and  cathode  materials  during  cycling.  Specific  chemistries  differ significantly in this respect, suggesting that the relation between rapid cycling and long-term cycling may also differ significantly. An accelerated test that accurately projects useful life for one chemistry may therefore predict poor life for another chemistry, even though both chemistries may achieve an equal life in actual use.
22. Furthermore,  accelerated  ageing  cannot  take  into  account  the  real  use  of  batteries inside vehicles and therefore can only partially estimate the real degradation.
23. To monitor degradation in-use, most manufacturers employ some form of in situ, onboard  capacity  estimation  through  the  BMS.  This  estimation  can  vary  in  accuracy  and precision depending on a number of factors including the sensors and estimation algorithm used, the charge/discharge behaviour of the user, and the cell type and cell model parameters. Proprietary algorithms are used to handle inaccuracies and output an estimate that can be utilised by other systems within the vehicle.
24. There are currently no requirements on the accuracy of on-board monitors and the estimates generated are not typically easily accessible to the vehicle user. The IWG on EVE has therefore made a decision to set the performance requirement in this field.

## D. Technical rationale and justification

25. The mandate of the first phase of this GTR on in-vehicle battery durability includes the development of:
2. (a) Requirements  for  reading  and/or  displaying  battery  health  information  and usage data from the vehicle;
3. (b) Requirements for electrified vehicle  battery  durability  performance  criteria;

and

- (c) A  provisional  in-service  conformity  test  which  will  include  generic  usage criteria and a statistical method.
26. This section sets out the key considerations of the IWG on EVE in developing the respective elements of Phase 1 of the GTR as set out above.

## State-of-Certified Range and State-of Certified Energy (SOCR and SOCE) monitors

27. Whilst the term State of Health (SOH) is commonly applied to refer to the health of a battery  at  a  given  point  in  its  life,  this  term  is  not  commonly  defined  and  is  determined through  a  variety  of  different  methodologies.  It  was  therefore  chosen  to  define  two  new related metrics for use within the GTR: the State of Certified Energy (SOCE) and the State of  Certified  Range  (SOCR).  Both  metrics  represent  a  percentage  of  the  certified  battery energy or electric range remaining at a given point in time. In the case of SOCE, it was decided to base the metric on the Usable Battery Energy (UBE).
28. Metrics based upon electric range and UBE were both chosen as the values can be determined through the respective certification test methodologies already applied within the Contracting Parties and are based on key performance parameters relating to battery health. These  metrics  are  intended  to  provide  both  the  basis  of  information  made  available  to consumers  and  also  values  for  assessment  against  Minimum  Performance  Requirements (MPR) relating to battery durability by manufacturers and authorities. The IWG decided to exclude NOVC-HEVs from Phase 1 of the GTR development. While batteries of NOVCHEVs can experience degradation, NOVC-HEVs have no electric range, and their battery UBE is not typically determined at certification. Moreover, battery degradation in an NOVCHEV is likely to result in degradation of fuel economy, which can be detected by existing inservice conformity practices. The IWG will continue to consider the need for extending this GTR to NOVC-HEVs in the future.
29. From discussions within the IWG it was concluded that it would not be appropriate to define  the  process  or  algorithm  by  which  the  SOCR  or  SOCE  monitors  determine  their estimated values. It would be highly complex to define an algorithm that could accurately account for the  range  of  battery  cell  chemistry  and  battery  management  strategies  in  use within the market. Instead, it was determined to allow manufacturers to determine their own means to estimate these metrics, whilst ensuring the accuracy through an in-use verification procedure.

## Battery performance requirements

30. The key battery durability requirements set out within this GTR are defined in terms of MPR. MPR are expressed as a minimum allowable value of SOCE or SOCR after a given length of time or distance travelled. This follows a similar format applied by manufacturers when providing warranty for electrified vehicles.
31. In determining appropriate MPR values for this GTR the IWG on EVE considered a range of publicly available data as well as input from stakeholders within the IWG, which is summarised paragraphs 32. to 37. below.
32. Warranty analysis was conducted by the US EPA to understand the current warranty offering from manufacturers for electric vehicle batteries. The review primarily focussed on the US market, but values were also consistent with typical offerings within the European market. The review showed that batteries are covered for failure for between 7 to 10 years and typically up to 160,000 km * . Warranties that define failure in terms of a specific capacity retention  specified  between  60  and  75  per  cent  retention,  most  commonly  70  per  cent. Warranty offerings of 8 years or 160,000 kilometres were found to be the most common. It has been highlighted by manufacturers that warranty offerings are not based solely on the technical performance of the battery and include further considerations from a commercial and customer satisfaction perspective. Nevertheless, the review provides an insight into the degree of confidence in products currently on the market.

*   Only one vehicle manufacturer provides warranty up to 1,000,000 km

33. The European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) has developed a dedicated in-vehicle  battery  durability  assessment  module  within  its  'Transport  tEchnology  and Mobility Assessment' (TEMA) platform. This is based on performance-based models as this class  of  models  is  the  most  suitable  to  be  used  with  large-scale  real-world  driving  data. TEMA is a modular big data platform designed to reproduce mobility behaviours of vehicles from datasets of navigation system data of conventional fuel vehicles and quantify possible impacts of new vehicle technologies on real-world mobility while supporting transport policy assessment.
34. TEMA  combines  recent  performance-based  capacity  and  power  fade  models  for Lithium-ion batteries from literature with information on battery and vehicle architectures, together with real world vehicle driving data from different geographical areas of Europe, to develop  a  scenario-based  analysis  for  predicting  in-vehicle  performance  degradation  of automotive traction batteries. The analysis includes the calendar and cycle capacity fade of three Lithium-ion variants (LiFePO4, NCM with spinel Mn and NCM-LMO) in different vehicle architectures (OVC-HEV and PEV of different driving range segments), combined with  different  recharging  strategies  to  explore  the  effect  of  different  driving  duty  cycles related to different mobility patterns and environmental temperatures. Preliminary analyses on vehicle battery power fade have been also carried out.
35. The TEMA model was used to estimate the capacity retention of traction batteries after a range of distances and time periods to allow consideration of appropriate choices for MPR. Example TEMA modelling results in Figure  I/1 for two different mid-sized BEVs configurations  either  charged  with  slow  or  fast  charging  show  greater  than  70 per cent capacity retention after 8 years. This result is generally consistent with prevailing warranty practice  observed  in  the  warranty  survey.  Additionally,  good  agreement  was  previously found between TEMA modelling results and electric vehicle lifetime performance testing data provided by Environment and Climate Change Canada and Transport Canada during work within the previous mandate of the IWG on EVE.

Figure I/1 Example of a capacity retention curve generated from JRC TEMA modelling for two different BEV configurations

The figure presents a cumulative density function (CDF) and probability distribution of battery capacity retention for mid-sized battery electric vehicles (BEVs) after 8 years of operation. The CDF plot shows the cumulative probability of capacity retention on the y-axis (0 to 1) versus capacity retention percentage on the x-axis (65% to 90%). The probability distribution plot shows the probability of capacity retention on the y-axis (0 to 1) versus capacity retention percentage on the x-axis (65% to 90%). The CDF indicates that approximately 0% of vehicles retain less than 75% capacity, while nearly 100% retain less than 87% capacity. The probability distribution shows a peak probability around 80% capacity retention. This data informs battery sizing and warranty considerations, suggesting that designs should account for a likely capacity degradation to approximately 80% after 8 years to meet performance requirements and manage customer expectations.

36. Geotab is a U.S. company that collects in-use data from vehicle fleets, and provides a publicly available set of estimated battery degradation histories computed from data collected from  different  makes  and  model  years  of  BEVs  and  PHEVs.  Raw  data  is  sourced  from telematics  from  6,300  fleet  and  consumer  vehicles,  covering  21  vehicle  models  and

representing 64 distinct combinations of makes, models and years. The data is then converted to SOH estimates by means of a proprietary algorithm applied to the collected data, such as current and voltage measurements during charge and discharge. The data (see Figure I/2) also provides some insight into  extreme  vehicle use,  extreme climates  and  charging  methods. SOH estimates from Geotab were examined to understand the typical battery durability of existing vehicles in the fleet and also to compare with ageing predictions  from the JRC's TEMA model, resulting in good correlation.

Figure I/2 Example comparison between estimated results from the TEMA model with in-use data from Geotab

1.  Context: The figure consists of two plots illustrating the capacity fade of electric vehicle (EV) batteries over time, with the primary objective of quantifying battery degradation as a function of aging period and monthly mileage. The plots show the relationship between the aging period in years (x-axis) and the capacity fade in percentage (y-axis) for different vehicle types and usage patterns.

2.  Deconstruction: Each plot presents data for a specific mileage range: 1,500-2,000 km/month (left) and 1,000-1,500 km/month (right). The y-axis represents capacity fade, ranging from 50% to 105%. The x-axis represents the aging period, ranging from 0 to 10 years. Data points represent individual vehicles (BEV and PHEV) and simulated recharge scenarios. Trend lines depict average capacity fade for all vehicles, high-usage vehicles, and low-usage vehicles. The plots show a general trend of decreasing capacity fade with increasing aging period.

3.  Implication: The plots indicate that battery capacity fade is influenced by both the aging period and monthly mileage. Higher mileage (left plot) generally results in a steeper capacity fade compared to lower mileage (right plot). The trend lines provide a means to estimate the expected battery degradation for different usage patterns, which is critical for predicting battery lifespan, warranty planning, and designing battery management systems that mitigate degradation. The data suggests that managing vehicle usage and charging patterns can significantly impact long-term battery performance.

37. Further analysis of the publicly available Geotab data was conducted by Japan and the Alliance  for  Automotive  Innovation,  where  available  SOH  data  was  extrapolated  to  time points of 5 and 8 years to understand the expected SOH. Japan's analysis indicated that 90 percent  of  the  vehicle  models  within  the  sample  were  able  to  achieve  approximately  80 percent  SOH  after  5  years  and  70  percent  after  8  years.  The  Alliance  for  Automotive Innovation  conducted  similar  analysis,  but  also  included  probability  estimates  which indicated that between 85 and 90 percent of the current fleet covered by the Geotab data would be able to meet an 80 percent SOH target after 5 years.
38. Following consideration of the available evidence and views of stakeholders within the IWG on EVE, two sets of MPR values were introduced based upon two different time and distance combinations. This approach allows coverage of the wide range of different distance-based requirements needed across Contracting Parties and provides the option for a Contracting Party to optionally apply only one of the MPR if appropriate for their market.
39. The MPR values selected were deemed to be sufficiently achievable based on the available  evidence  presented  within  the  IWG,  whilst  also  being  sufficiently  stringent  to achieve the goal of preventing substandard products from entering the market. Following discussion within the IWG, the same MPR were set for OVC-HEVs and PEVs.
40. It was highlighted by manufacturers that the understanding and estimation of SOCR after a given duration of use or distance travelled currently presents an increased challenge compared to SOCE. There are many factors other than those originating from the battery leading to greater uncertainty of SOCR, including the measurement, test to test variability and precision of range retention calculations. As the majority of the evidence assessed by the IWG was also based primarily on remaining capacity or battery energy, it was decided to only monitor but not subject SOCR to an MPR requirement within Phase 1. No electric range based MPR have been selected at this point in time due to the above concerns with SOCR estimation. Inclusion of MPR for SOCR in future has, however, been highlighted as an area of importance for a number of Contracting Parties. Therefore, a placeholder for these values has been included to allow inclusion within a future amendment to the GTR.
41. Electrified vehicles of category 2 are at an earlier stage of adoption within the fleets of  many Contracting Parties and subsequently in-use data relating to battery durability is scarce for these vehicles. For this reason, it is difficult presently to determine a suitable and

achievable MPR for category 2 vehicles. It has been raised by manufacturers that in future the batteries of these vehicles may also be used for supplementary purposes, in addition to propulsion, which could have further impacts on battery durability that are not currently well understood. MPR values for category 2 vehicles therefore remain reserved for inclusion in a future amendment to this GTR.

42. Battery  longevity  is  a  key  consideration  for  consumers  and  regulating  agencies, therefore there is an incentive for manufacturers to accredit batteries that perform beyond the minimum  requirements  of  this  GTR.  To  allow  manufacturers  to  market  or  quantify  the benefits of any improved battery technology they may have installed within their vehicles the GTR  also  allows  for  a  Declared  Performance  Requirement  (DPR)  to  be  proposed  by manufacturers, based upon a higher value of SOCE/SOCR. To ensure the accuracy of any declared values, the DPR would be considered to act in place of the MPR for the purposes of in-use  verification.  The  DPR  is  not  intended  to  indicate  a  regulatory  warrantied  value. Manufacturer warranties are beyond the scope of this GTR. A manufacturer  may wish to warranty batteries beyond the MPR without attaching additional warranty benefits to a DPR.
43. The new MPR setting concept as depicted with the matrix below,  Figure I/3, was proposed by Japan in order to let each Contracting Party decide its own MPR as option. The matrix exemplified the area to be defined as substandard category of MPR and the area that the MPR can be determined.

The IWG considered this proposal and decided to not adopt it during the first phase.

Figure I/3 Sample of MPR Matrix

1.  Context: The figure is a plot illustrating the performance ratio (PR) of a system over time, measured in years and kilometers. The primary objective is to visualize the degradation of the PR over the operational lifespan of the system.

2.  Deconstruction: The plot has time (years/km) on the x-axis, ranging from 1 to 13, and performance ratio (PR) on the y-axis, ranging from -10% to 90%. Two distinct performance curves are shown. The first curve (dash-dot) starts at approximately 85% and decreases to approximately 65% over the 13-year period. The second curve (dotted) starts at approximately 75%, decreases to approximately 40% by year 8, and further decreases to approximately 35% by year 13. Both curves exhibit step-wise decreases, indicating performance drops at specific intervals.

3.  Implication: The figure indicates a degradation in performance ratio over time for both systems represented. The step-wise nature of the degradation suggests potential failure points or maintenance intervals. The second system exhibits a more significant performance drop compared to the first, indicating a potentially less robust design or different operational conditions. This data is critical for predicting system lifespan, planning maintenance schedules, and identifying areas for design improvement to enhance long-term performance.

## In-use verification

44. To ensure the accuracy of the SOCE/SOCR monitors and also ensure that MPR are being met it was necessary to introduce a two part in-use verification process, with Part A verifying the accuracy of the monitors and Part B verifying the battery durability against MPR.
45. Part  A  verification  involves  measurement  of  the  UBE/electric  range  under  the applicable test procedure and determination of a measured SOCE/SOCR by dividing by the respective values from certification. These measured values can then be compared to the onboard  values  from  the  SOCE/SOCR  monitors  to  ensure  the  accuracy  is  within  a  given tolerance. For this purpose, the resolution of the on-board values from SOCE/SOCR was set to 1 part in 100, and the required accuracy defined by a statistical process as described below.
46. A pass or fail decision on a sample of vehicles will be reached through a statistical process, which  evaluates the average of the ratios of measured/on-board-indicated SOCE/SOCR from a series  of  vehicles  tested.  After  testing  a  minimum  of  3  vehicles  a

decision on either a pass or fail decision or on testing a further vehicle will be reached, on the basis of a statistical formula considering the quantitative deviation of the latter average from a value A = (1 + tolerance) and the variance of these ratios over the whole test series with a tolerance = 5% granted for a single test due to technical reasons. The method proposed is particularly suitable for cases where a quantity (such as SOCE/SOCR) is likely to differ from the 'true' measured quantity continuously and reflects the method used for evaluating the conformity of production (CoP) in UN Regulation No. 154.

47. As Part A verification is expected to involve a relatively small number of sample vehicles to limit the testing burden, it is important to ensure that the sample result is not unduly impacted by the abnormal use or poor maintenance of a vehicle within the sample. A vehicle  survey  has  therefore  been  introduced  within  Annex 1  containing  information designed to ensure that the vehicle has been properly used and maintained according to the specifications of the manufacturer. Any vehicles not meeting the required criteria may be removed from the test sample.
48. Due to the accuracy of the SOCE/SOCR monitors being assured through verification in Part A, it is possible to verify the battery durability of a sample of vehicles within Part B through remote collection of the on-board SOCE/SOCR values, together with information on the age of the vehicles and the distance travelled. Where a vehicle has been equipped with V2X capabilities, an equivalent virtual distance will be calculated using the V2X discharge energy and the certified energy consumption. This will be summed with the distance travelled to calculate the total distance. This approach avoids the need for further testing of vehicles within Part B and enables a simple route to the assessment of a large sample size of vehicles, thereby minimising the impact that outliers (e.g. vehicles that have been used abnormally) may have on the sample result.
49. It is recognised that SOCE/SOCR values read from a sample of vehicles are likely to be in the form of a distribution, with values for individual vehicles dependent on the vehicle usage and any inherent variation in the performance of the vehicle or traction battery. Where a vehicle has been used abnormally (e.g. with prolonged periods of storage or being regularly used in extremes of temperature) this may also give rise to more significant degradation of battery health. To reduce the impact of vehicles that may have been used abnormally, it was decided to make the overall pass decision dependent on more than or equal to 90 per cent of monitor values read from the vehicle sample being above the MPR. This approach thereby ensures that the MPR is being met by the significant majority of the vehicle sample, whilst accounting for abnormal usage.
50. To further minimise influence of abnormally used vehicles, a maximum of 5 per cent of the values taken from smaller durability families that consist of less than 500 vehicles may be excluded from the verification sample in Part B with appropriate reasoning.
51. To support this two part in-use verification process, whilst minimising the burden of increased  testing  for  manufacturers  within  Part  A,  two  family  concepts  were  developed within the GTR. This includes the concept of a monitor family for use in Part A and a battery durability family for Part B. This is likely to reduce the need for additional testing where multiple  battery  durability  families  may  have  the  same  characteristics  with  respect  to verification of the SOCR/SOCE monitors. In addition, the Part A in-use verification for the vehicles in the same monitor family may be combined between different regions with the agreement  of  all  Contracting  Parties  involved.  This  contributes  not  only  to  minimise  the testing burden but also to increase the verification robustness. However, this concept shall not be applied for Part B since battery deterioration might be different in different regions due to different usage patterns and ambient conditions.

## E. Technical feasibility, anticipated costs and benefits

52. The  use  of  SOH  monitoring  within  some  electrified  vehicles  is  already  common practice and the improvement of monitor accuracy is an area under active development by manufacturers. Updating these monitors to ensure the specific requirements within this GTR are met and to allow information to be provided to the consumer may, however, entail some further development costs for manufacturers. Inclusion of SOCR for monitoring purposes

only  should  allow  manufacturers  time  to  gather  sufficient  data  and  further  develop  their understanding of range deterioration to make the inclusion of range-based MPR technically feasible in future.

53. The Part A verification of SOCE/SOCR accuracy will involve additional testing by manufacturers and, optionally, by authorities who choose to further verify monitor accuracy. The additional costs associated with testing have been mitigated to an extent by making use of  the  relevant  test  procedure  already  applied  for  range  (or  UBE)  determination  in  the respective  Contracting  Party. This  should  allow  manufacturers  to  incorporate verification into any existing verification programme planned for those vehicles.
54. Any costs associated with verification within Part B are likely to be  borne by the authorities of the Contracting Parties applying this regulation and will depend on the extent and means by which they choose to collect data for verification. Costs may be borne by the manufacturer  in  the  case  of  a  fail  for  a  battery  durability  family  relating  to  the  costs  of measures agreed with the relevant authorities to bring those vehicles back into compliance.
55. This GTR is likely to give rise to benefits for manufacturers and authorities through the  prevention  of  inferior  products  which  could  undermine  the  market.  Introduction  of inferior  products  within  the  market  could  disadvantage  those  manufacturers  who  have invested in the development of technology aimed at ensuring battery longevity and could also undermine the  environmental  benefits  that  can  arise  from  electrified  vehicles,  as  well  as public acceptance.
56. The longevity of battery life is a key concern for prospective consumers of electrified vehicles. The health of a vehicle's battery upon entry into the second-hand market is also a significant point of consideration for the consumer and is not easily understood in the absence of access to accurate battery health monitors. The availability of both accurate battery health information and assurances on battery longevity for consumers that is provided by this GTR are therefore likely to have a positive impact on the cost retention of electric vehicles and consumer confidence in buying an electrified vehicle.

## F. Future development of the GTR

57. The  mandate  for  development  of  this  GTR  included  the  future  development  of improvements to the GTR within Phase 2 that includes, but not limited to:
2. (a) The development of a methodology to define Normal Usage Indices (NUIs) based on data read from vehicles; and
3. (b) Refined  performance  criteria  requirements  for  in-vehicle  battery  durability through assessment of further modelling and data collected from real vehicles and the use of NUIs.
58. The concept of an NUI is a data field stored on the vehicle that represents a history or assessment of lifetime usage patterns of the vehicle that are influential to battery degradation. For  example,  one  NUI  might  characterise  temperature  exposures  during  the  life  of  the vehicle, while another might characterise charging rates or number of fast-charging events. The definition  of  NUIs  was highlighted  within  the  discussions  of  the IWG  on  EVE  as  a technically challenging task that will require further data collection and validation to achieve. It could, however, provide an alternative and more robust means of handling SOCE/SOCR values recorded from vehicles that have been used abnormally in future. The possibility of incorporating NUIs within this GTR should therefore be explored.
59. The implementation of this GTR by Contracting Parties will enable the collection of further  data  on  SOCE  and  SOCR  to  better  inform  our  understanding  of  battery  health degradation. This information will, in turn, allow further refinement of the GTR, including MPR  values,  based  upon  the  latest  available  battery  technologies  employed  within  the market. This will be important given the rapid development of technology in the field of battery technology for electrified vehicles that is already underway.
60. The  monitoring  of  SOCR  values  following  the  implementation  of  this  GTR  will provide  a  sound  basis  for  the  consideration  of  appropriate  range-based  MPR  in  a  future

revision  to  this  GTR.  Equally,  the  monitoring  of  both  SOCE  and  SOCR  for  category  2 vehicles should allow the inclusion of MPR for this category of vehicle in future.

## II. Text of the GTR

## 1. Purpose

This Global Technical Regulation provides a worldwide harmonized method to  set  and  verify  minimum  performance  requirements  on  in-vehicle  battery durability of Pure Electric Vehicles (PEVs) and Off-vehicle Charging Hybrid Electric Vehicles (OVC-HEVs).

## 2. Scope and application

This GTR applies to vehicles of categories 1-2 and 2, that have a technically permissible maximum laden mass not exceeding 3,855 kg, and to vehicles of category 1-1,  that  (a)  are  PEV  or  OVC-HEV  vehicles,  and  (b)  have  an originally installed battery as defined in this GTR.

At the option of the Contracting Party, the scope may be limited to 3,500 kg for the relevant categories.

While  manufacturers  commonly  estimate  or  publicise  other  range-based metrics for informational purposes (such as, for example, an in-use range under real  driving  conditions,  or  the  remaining  range  available  before  the  next charging event), the range-related provisions of this GTR are concerned only with the certified range as would be measured by the applicable certification test procedure.

The authorities shall make a decision about the applicability of this GTR to Small Volume Manufacturers for their jurisdiction.

## 3. Definitions

The following definitions shall apply in this Global Technical Regulation.

- 3.1. "Battery" means, in the context of this GTR, a rechargeable electrical energy storage system (REESS) installed in an electrified vehicle and used mainly for traction purposes.
- 3.2. "Originally installed battery" means the battery that is installed in the vehicle at  the  time  of  manufacture,  or  if  the  vehicle  is  manufactured  without  an installed  battery,  the  battery  that  is  installed  in  the  vehicle  when  it  is  first operated on the road.
- 3.3. "Usable Battery energy (UBE)" means the energy supplied by the battery from the beginning of the test procedure used for certification until the applicable break-off criterion of the test procedure used for certification is reached.
- 3.4. "Certified  usable  battery  energy" (UBEcertified)  refers  to  the  UBE  that  was determined during the certification of the vehicle, according to Annex 3 of this GTR.
- 3.5. "Measured usable battery energy" (UBEmeasured) means the UBE determined at the present point in the lifetime of the vehicle by the test procedure used for certification, according to Annex 3 of this GTR.
- 3.6. "Electric Range" refers to the range that would be determined by the range test procedure used for certification of the vehicle, if the test was performed at the present point in the lifetime of the vehicle and  with the originally installed battery.

1.  Objective: The table provides definitions for key terms and acronyms related to electric vehicle performance, battery characteristics, and energy management strategies, as used within the context of a specific Global Technical Regulation (GTR).

2.  Layout: The table is structured as a single column, with each row presenting a numbered entry. Each entry consists of a defined term or acronym (e.g., "Certified range," "SOCE," "V2X") followed by a descriptive explanation of its meaning and application within the GTR. The definitions often reference specific vehicle characteristics, testing procedures, or operational contexts.

3.  Significance: This table serves as a crucial reference for understanding the technical specifications and performance requirements outlined in the GTR. It facilitates consistent interpretation and application of the regulation by providing clear and unambiguous definitions for key concepts related to electric vehicle technology and energy usage. This is essential for manufacturers, regulators, and other stakeholders involved in the development, testing, and certification of electric vehicles.

| 3.7.   | "Certified range" (Range certified ) refers to the electric driving range that was determined during certification of the vehicle, according to Annex 3 of this GTR.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| 3.11.  | "Minimum Performance Requirement" (MPR) means the minimum durability performance, in terms of SOCE or SOCR at a specific point in the life of the vehicle, that constitutes compliance with the durability provisions of this GTR.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 3.12.  | "Declared Performance Requirement" (DPR) means an SOCE or SOCR value declared by the manufacturer that is greater than that of the corresponding MPR and which then becomes the minimum durability performance that constitutes compliance of that manufacturer with the durability provisions of this GTR.                                                                                                                                                                       |

## 5. Requirements

## 5.1. State-of-Certified  Range  and  State-of  Certified  Energy  (SOCR  and  SOCE) monitors

The manufacturer shall install SOCR and SOCE monitors that operate during the life of the vehicle. The SOCR monitor shall maintain an estimate of the state  of  certified  range  (on-board  SOCR),  and  the  SOCE  monitor  shall maintain an estimate of the state of certified energy (on-board SOCE).

The manufacturer shall determine the algorithms by which on-board SOCR and  on-board  SOCE  are  determined  for  the  vehicles  they  produce.  The manufacturer  shall  update  the  on-board  SOCR  and  SOCE  with  sufficient frequency as to maintain the necessary degree of accuracy during all normal vehicle operation.

The on-board SOCR and SOCE shall have a resolution of 1 part in 100 and be reported as the nearest whole number from 0 to 100.

The manufacturer shall make available the most recently determined values of the on-board SOCR and on-board SOCE via the OBD port and optionally overthe-air (OTA).

For the purposes of consumer information, the manufacturer shall make easily available to the owner of the vehicle the most recently determined value of the SOCE monitor  via  at  least  one  appropriate  method.  The  resolution  for  the customer values shall be determined in  agreement with the authorities. For example:

- (a) dashboard indicator;
- (b) infotainment system;
- (c) remote access (such as via mobile-phone applications).

## 5.2. Battery Performance Requirements

The  battery  durability  requirements  of  this  GTR  are  defined  in  terms  of Minimum  Performance  Requirements  (MPR i ),  which  represent  minimum allowable values for SOCE and SOCR at specific points in the lifetime of the vehicle. Vehicles falling under the categories of OVC-HEVs and PEVs shall meet  both  of  the  Minimum  Performance  Requirements  in  Tables  1  and  2 below. The MPRs may differ depending on the category of the vehicle and type of propulsion.

In order to address regional considerations, a Contracting Party may optionally elect  to  enforce  only  one  of  the  two  Minimum  Performance  Requirements (MPR i )  in  each of the tables below  (i.e. either the one ending at 5 years or 100,000 km, or the one ending at 8 years or 160,000 km).

Table 1

## Battery Energy based (SOCE) MPR

1.  Objective: The table presents range-based (SOCR) Minimum Performance Requirements (MPR) for Overcharge Capable Hybrid Electric Vehicles (OVC-HEV) and Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEV) based on vehicle age and mileage.
2.  Layout: The table is structured with rows representing different vehicle age/kilometer ranges, categorized by Global Technical Regulation (GTR) scope (categories 1-1, 1-2, and 2). Columns delineate the vehicle type (OVC-HEV and PEV) and their corresponding MPR values, with some values indicated as "Reserved." The table is divided into sections based on the GTR category.
3.  Significance: This table serves as a reference for understanding the range-based performance requirements for OVC-HEV and PEV vehicles under specific GTR categories. It facilitates comparison of requirements across vehicle types and age/mileage ranges, aiding in regulatory compliance, vehicle design, and performance evaluation. The "Reserved" entries indicate areas where specific requirements are not yet defined or publicly available.

| Vehicles more than 5 years or 100,000 km, and up to whichever comes first of 8 years or 160,000 km | (Reserved)  | (Reserved)  |

SOCR and SOCE monitors of vehicles of category 2 and SOCR monitors of category 1-1 and 1-2 vehicles shall be installed and their values monitored in view of setting the values in the tables in a future amendment of this GTR.

A manufacturer may elect to  declare  a  Declared  Performance  Requirement (DPR i )  having  an  SOCE and/or SOCR value that is higher than that of the corresponding MPR. The DPR i shall then replace the MPR i for the purposes of determining compliance by that manufacturer.

The manufacturer shall ensure that batteries installed in vehicles comply with the rules specified in paragraph 6.4.2. for the MPR i (or DPR i if applicable).

At the request of the manufacturer and for vehicles designed with V2X, the equivalent  virtual  distance  calculated  following  the  equation  below  will  be reported by each vehicle.

total discharge energy during V2X [𝑊ℎ]

## 𝑽𝒊𝒓𝒕𝒖𝒂𝒍 𝒅𝒊𝒔𝒕𝒂𝒏𝒄𝒆 (𝑘𝑚) = ( worst case certified energy consumption of PART B family [Wh/km] )

## Where:

"worst case certified energy consumption of Part B family" means the worst case certified energy consumption of a Part B family which needs to be provided according to Annex 2.

At the option of the manufacturer, instead of using the worst case certified energy  consumption  value  of  the  Part  B  family,  the  manufacturer  may  be allowed to use any higher energy consumption value.

The  total  distance  used  for  confirming  the  compliance  with  the  minimum performance requirements will consist of the sum of the distance driven and the  virtual  distance.  The  total  percentage  of  the  virtual  distance  shall  be recorded and monitored.

## 6. In-Use Verification

## 6.1. Definitions of Families

Vehicles having the same characteristics with respect to their evaluation under Part A or Part B below shall be grouped into vehicle families for the purpose of  compliance  verification.  Families  under  Part A  shall  have  the  same characteristics  with  respect  to  verification  of  the  SOCR/SOCE  monitors. Families  under  Part B  shall  have  the  same  characteristics  with  respect  to verification of battery durability.

Families with the same characteristics with respect to compliance verification shall be defined as follows:

## 6.1.1. For Part A: Verification of Monitors

Only  vehicles  that  are  substantially  similar  with  respect  to  the  following elements may be part of the same monitor family:

- (a) Algorithm for estimating on-board SOCR and on-board SOCE;
- (b) Sensor configuration (for sensors used in determination of SOCR and SOCE estimates);
- (c) Characteristics of battery cell which have a non-negligible influence on accuracy of monitor;
- (d) Type of vehicle (PEVs or OVC-HEVs).

At  the  request  of  the  manufacturer,  with  the  approval  of  the  responsible authority and with appropriate technical justification, the manufacturer may deviate from the above criteria for families.

## 6.1.2. For Part B: Verification of Battery Durability

Only  vehicles  that  are  substantially  similar  with  respect  to  the  following elements may be part of the same battery durability family:

- (a) Type and number of electric machines, including net power, construction  type  (asynchronous/  synchronous,  etc.),  and  any  other characteristics having a non-negligible influence on battery durability;
- (b) Type  of  battery  (dimensions,  type  of  cell,  including  format  and chemistry, capacity (Ampere-hour), nominal voltage, nominal power;
- (c) Battery management system (BMS) (with regards to battery durability monitoring and estimations);
- (d) Passive and active thermal management of the battery;

- (e) Type  of  electric  energy  converter  between  the  electric  machine  and battery,  between  the  recharge-plug-in  and  battery,  and  any  other characteristics having a non-negligible influence on battery durability;
- (f) Operation strategy of all components influencing the battery durability;
- (g) Declared maximum charging power.

At  the  request  of  the  manufacturer,  with  the  approval  of  the  responsible authority and with appropriate technical justification, the manufacturer may deviate from the above criteria for families.

## 6.2. Information gathering

The following information shall be made available to the authorities by the manufacturer  in  a  format  to  be  agreed  between  the  authorities  and  the manufacturer: annual report on relevant warranty claims; and annual statistics on repairs for both batteries and other systems that might influence the electric energy consumption of the vehicle. Such information shall be made available once a year for each battery durability family for the duration of the period defined in paragraph 5.2. after the last vehicle of this family is sold.

## 6.3. Part A: Verification of SOCR/SOCE monitors

## 6.3.1. Frequency of verifications

The  manufacturer  shall  complete  the  procedure  for  in-use  verification  for Part A with a frequency agreed with the authorities, until 5 or 8 years as defined in paragraph 5.2. after the last vehicle of each monitor family is sold and report the results of the verification to the authorities. The authorities may decide to proceed with their own verification of Part A, at a frequency and magnitude based on risk assessment, or request more information from the manufacturers. With the agreement of all Contracting Parties involved, the verification of Part A for vehicles in the same monitor family may be combined between different Contracting  Parties.  In  such  cases  the  relevant  Contracting  Parties  shall  be considered as a single authority for the purposes of this verification.

At the option of the Contracting Party, the verification of the monitors shall not be mandatory if the annual sales of the monitor family are less than 5,000 vehicles in the market for the previous year. Such families may still be selected to be tested for Part A, at the request of the responsible authorities.

## 6.3.2. Verification procedure

In order to verify the SOCR/SOCE monitors, the values for range and usable battery energy shall be measured at the time of the verification and the related values  from  the  monitors  shall  be  collected  before  the  verification  test procedure. To support future improvement of the GTR, indicator values shall be collected again after the verification test procedure. Those indicators read after  the  verification  test  procedure  shall  not  be  considered  in  the  Part  A verification.

The  measured  SOCR  and  measured  SOCE  values  shall  be  determined  by dividing  the  measured  values  for  range  and  usable  battery  energy  by  the certified values for range and usable battery energy, respectively, expressed in per cent.

In cases where UBEmeasured is higher than the UBEcertified, the SOCEmeasured shall be  set  to  100 per cent.  In  cases  where  Rangemeasured  is  higher  than  the Rangecertified, the SOCRmeasured shall be set to 100 per cent.

Statistical Method for Pass/Fail decision for a sample of vehicles

Separate statistics shall be calculated for the SOCR monitor and the SOCE monitor.

An adequate number of vehicles (at least 3 and not more than 16) shall be selected from the same monitor family for testing following a vehicle survey (see Annex 1) which contains information designed to ensure that the vehicle has been properly used and maintained according to the specifications of the manufacturer. The following statistics shall be used to take a decision on the accuracy of the monitor.

For evaluating the SOCR/SOCE  monitors  normalised  values  shall be calculated:

where the parameters t P1,N , t P2,N, t F1,N, and tF2 are taken from Table 3.

Table 3

Pass/fail decision criteria for the sample size

1.  Objective: The table presents performance metrics for a series of tests, categorized by whether they passed or failed.
2.  Layout: The table is organized with the number of tests (N) in the first column, ranging from 3 to 16. Subsequent columns are grouped under "PASS" and "FAIL" categories. Under "PASS," two metrics, tP1,N and tP2,N, are provided. Under "FAIL," two metrics, tF1,N and tF2, are provided. The table structure allows for a direct comparison of these metrics based on the test outcome (pass or fail) and the number of tests performed.
3.  Significance: This table is valuable for analyzing the relationship between the number of tests and the performance metrics under both passing and failing conditions. It facilitates the identification of trends, potential thresholds, or anomalies in the data, which can inform process optimization, quality control, or further investigation into the factors influencing test outcomes.

## 6.3.4. Corrective measures for the SOCR and SOCE monitors

A fail decision for the sample means that the monitors fail to report accurately the  durability  of  the  system  and  appropriate  action  shall  be  taken  by  the manufacturer with the agreement of the responsible authority. This may lead to the requirement that the manufacturer repairs or replaces the faulty monitor including the relevant sensors or by applying software measures in all affected vehicles in the monitor family.

A pass decision or correction of the non-compliance is required for proceeding with Part B.

Part B: Verification of Battery Durability

Frequency of verifications

Data shall be collected yearly by the authorities from a statistically adequate sample of vehicles within the same battery durability family. The decision on the  number  of  the  vehicles  in  the  sample  may  be  taken  by  the  responsible authority based on risk assessment methodology, but in principle should not be less than 500.

If the number of vehicles in the sample is less than 500, then on the request of the  manufacturer  and  with  the  agreement  of  the  responsible  authority,  a maximum of 5 per cent of the values may be excluded from the sample. In such a case, the manufacturer needs to provide adequate information on the reason behind the exclusion for each vehicle to the authority.

If the number of vehicles in the sample is equal to or more than 500, then all vehicles shall be included in the sample. The data read shall be those of the SOCR and SOCE monitors (and other relevant data, such as those defined in Annex 2). SOCR and SOCE monitors of vehicles of category 2 and SOCR monitors of category 1-1 and 1-2 vehicles shall be monitored.

6.4.2. Pass/Fail Criteria for the battery durability family

A battery durability family shall pass if equal to or more than 90 per cent of monitor values read from the vehicle sample are above the MPR i or DPR i .

## 6.4.

6.4.1.

A battery durability family shall fail if less than 90 per cent of monitor values read from the vehicle sample are above the MPR i or DPR i .

## 6.4.3. Corrective Measures for the Battery Durability Family

In case of a fail for a battery durability family, corrective measures shall be taken  with  the  agreement  of the  responsible  authority  in  order  to  bring  the family or part of the family affected by the issue into compliance.

## 6.5. Process flow charts for Part A and Part B

The flow charts below illustrate the various steps in the verification process of Part A (Figure 1) and Part B (Figure 2).

Figure 1

Flow chart for Part A: Verification of Monitors

1.  Context: The figure is a flowchart outlining the process for verifying vehicle monitors, specifically focusing on the State of Charge Estimation (SOCE) and State of Charge Range (SOCR) parameters. The primary objective is to define a structured methodology for assessing the performance and accuracy of these monitors in vehicles.
2.  Deconstruction: The flowchart begins with vehicle procurement and a survey. It then checks for exclusion criteria; if met, the vehicle is excluded or the monitor is updated. SOCE/SOCR data is obtained before and after any updates, with specific instructions on which data to use for monitoring and Part A verification. A verification test is performed, measuring SOCE/SOCR. The process includes a feedback loop based on whether more testing is needed, determined by paragraph 6.3.3. The final step is a pass/fail decision, also based on paragraph 6.3.3.
3.  Implication: The flowchart dictates a specific sequence of steps for monitor verification, emphasizing the importance of SOCE/SOCR data. The inclusion of exclusion criteria and monitor updates highlights the need to account for variations in vehicle configurations and monitor versions. The iterative testing loop ensures that monitors meet performance requirements before a final pass/fail decision is made. This process is critical for ensuring the reliability and accuracy of vehicle monitors, which directly impacts system performance and safety.

Figure 2 Flow chart for Part B : Verification of Battery Durability

## Part B : Verification of Battery Durability

1.  Context: The figure is a flowchart outlining the data processing steps for a pass/fail decision based on annual sample size. The primary objective is to define the criteria for determining whether a dataset is sufficient for evaluation or requires data exclusion.
2.  Deconstruction: The flowchart begins with data acquisition. The first decision point checks if the annual sample size exceeds 500. If "YES", the process proceeds directly to a pass/fail decision. If "NO", a secondary step allows for the exclusion of a maximum of 5% of the data, subject to agreement from a responsible authority, before proceeding to the pass/fail decision. The final step is the pass/fail decision.
3.  Implication: The flowchart establishes a minimum sample size threshold (500) for direct evaluation. If the sample size is below this threshold, a controlled data exclusion mechanism is implemented to potentially improve data quality before the final pass/fail assessment. This ensures that datasets with insufficient samples are either augmented or refined before being used for decision-making, potentially reducing the risk of false negatives.

## 7. Rounding

- 7.1. When the digit immediately to the right of the last place to be retained is less than 5, that last digit retained shall remain unchanged.

Example:

If a result is 1.2344 kWh but only three places of decimal are to be retained, the final result shall be 1.234 kWh.

- 7.2. When the digit immediately to the right of the last place to be retained is greater than or equal to 5, that last digit retained shall be increased by 1.

## Example:

If a result is 1.2346 kWh but only three places of decimal are to be retained, and because 6 is greater than 5, the final result shall be 1.235 kWh.

## Annex 1

## Vehicle Survey

The  vehicle  survey  shall  be  used  for  all  vehicles  selected  for  testing  in  Part  A  of  the verification. Vehicles that fall under one of the exclusion criteria below shall be eliminated from testing, or otherwise updated according to the procedures described below.

1.  Objective: The table serves as a standardized form for recording vehicle characteristics and test details during an investigation or verification process.
2.  Layout: The table is organized into rows representing specific data points, grouped under general headings such as "Date," "Name of Investigator," "Location of Test," "Country of Registration," and "Vehicle Characteristics." Each row corresponds to a specific attribute or parameter to be recorded. Columns indicate whether the data point is "Exclusive on Criteria," "Checked and Reported," or considered "Confidential." The "Vehicle Characteristics" section includes details like registration information, vehicle identification number (VIN), engine specifications, electric powertrain details (if applicable), and other relevant technical specifications.
3.  Significance: This table provides a structured framework for collecting and documenting essential vehicle information, ensuring consistency and completeness in data gathering. It facilitates standardized reporting and analysis, enabling comparisons between vehicles and supporting informed decision-making in regulatory compliance, performance evaluation, or research contexts. The table's design allows for clear identification of data points that are critical for specific criteria, verified through inspection, or require restricted access.

## Annex 3

## Determination of Performance Parameter during Part A Test Procedure

## 1. General

For the calculation of SOCEmeasured and SOCRmeasured according to paragraph 6.3.2.  of  this  GTR,  the  measured  and  certified  values  of  usable battery energy (UBE) and electric range (PER for PEVs and EAER for OVCHEVs) are required:

- UBEmeasured and UBEcertified
- Rangemeasured and Rangecertified

This annex describes the determination of these parameters in case of WLTP, in  paragraph  2.  for  PEVs  and  in  paragraph  3.  for  OVC-HEVs  and  gives guidance on which measurements need to be performed and which certified values  need  to  be  applied  for  a  vehicle  selected  in  the  Part  A  verification procedure.  Regions  that  do  not  apply  UN  GTR  No.  15  (GTR15)  or  UN Regulation  No.  154,  shall  define  an  alternative  solution  informed  by  the guidance below.

For the purposes of this annex, for PEVs the term 'battery' includes not only REESS used mainly for traction purposes, but also all other REESSs.

| UBE measured | UBE measured shall be the usable battery energy calculated as follows: 𝑈BE 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 = UBE 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑,𝑛𝑐 -∆𝐸 𝑅𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆,CC 𝑎𝑣𝑒 Where: UBE measured,nc is the non-corrected usable battery energy of the charge-depleting test, Wh; ∆𝐸 𝑅𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆,CC 𝑎𝑣𝑒 is the average electric energy change of the confirmation cycle, Wh; CC means confirmation cycle as defined in GTR15 Annex 8, paragraph 3.2.4.4.. The correction with the average electric energy change in the confirmation cycle is required as the break-off criterion, according to GTR 15 Annex 8, paragraph 3.2.4.5., allows a toggling around the absolute reference level. The correction shall compensate for this effect and is visualized in the following figure: |

1.  Context: The figure is a plot designed to illustrate the energy consumption and speed profile of a vehicle during a "Confirmation Cycle," focusing on the energy change of the Rechargeable Energy Storage System (REESS). The primary objective is to analyze and compare different methods of calculating energy change within the REESS during this cycle.
2.  Deconstruction: The plot displays two curves against a common x-axis representing distance (implied, but not explicitly stated). The y-axis on the left represents both energy in Wh (black curve) and speed in km/h (gray curve). The black curve shows the energy level of the REESS over the cycle, while the gray curve shows the vehicle speed. A dashed horizontal line represents the average energy level during the cycle. The figure highlights three energy change values: ΔE_REESS,end,CC,nc (non-corrected), ΔE_REESS,ave,CC (average), and ΔE_REESS,end,CC (corrected), representing the difference between the final energy level and the average energy level.
3.  Implication: The figure demonstrates the energy change calculation methods for the REESS during a confirmation cycle. The difference between the non-corrected and corrected energy change values indicates the impact of correction factors on the energy consumption analysis. This information is crucial for accurate energy management and performance evaluation of the vehicle's REESS, informing design decisions related to energy efficiency and system optimization.

The required input parameter ∆𝐸𝑅𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆,𝐶𝐶,𝑎𝑣𝑒 is calculated as follows:

1.  Context: The figure presents a mathematical equation that calculates the average change in energy (ΔE) for a Renewable Energy and Energy Storage System (REESS) within a specific context, likely related to charge cycles (CC). The equation aims to quantify the overall energy variation by summing individual energy changes.

2.  Deconstruction: The equation states that the average change in REESS energy (ΔE_REESS.CC,ave) is equal to the sum (Σ) of individual average energy changes (ΔE_REESS,avg,i,CC) over 'n' iterations, where 'i' represents the iteration number, ranging from 1 to 'n'. The subscript "CC" indicates that these energy changes are specifically related to charge cycles.

3.  Implication: This equation provides a method to determine the overall energy fluctuation within a REESS during charge cycles. Engineers can use this to assess the system's energy efficiency, predict performance degradation, and optimize charging strategies. The value of 'n' is critical, as it defines the scope of the analysis. A larger 'n' provides a more comprehensive average, while a smaller 'n' may be useful for targeted analysis of specific charge cycle segments.
